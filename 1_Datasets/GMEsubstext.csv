Total Number of Shorts?,"Ok I'm going to speak in very general terms here. GME is roughly 140% institutionally owed. That doesn't include insider's, ETFs, other funds, or the shares that GME holds in reserve. These shares added to the  institutional ownership gets us to about  200% owned. We have no way of knowing exactly how many shares retail holds at this point but i don't think 70 million is a stretch given wsb alon is 9 million apes strong. That would nean the company is 300% owned. As far as I understand that would mean there are 140 million shorts of one kind or another (210 million-70 million). Yet the reported shorts are only 14 million? This is such a huge gap that I have to be an idiot right?

How to handle the halts,"Whats an exit strategy? 

Really, in this MOASS, WTF is an exit strategy? I know there is a lot of data out there, and personal opinions and plans, but there's one thing I haven't seen addressed.... the fucking halts.

When this blows off like Ron Jeremy in his prime, we won't see it in real time. Fuck, we had several 5 minute halts for a 100 buckaroo manipulation this past week. So, how do we handle a.) The mental toll this thing is going to take (anxiety and ecstacy) b.) The periods of time where we don't know wtf is happening and c.) How do we know when to take our tendies?

Limit sells: will they work? If I set a limit at 23k, but the stonk halts at 19k and comes back to life at 27k, do we get the 23k or the 27k? Will the lower limit sells activating upon the ceasing of the halt hurt the stonk, or does it act as it was sold on the way up?

Market sells: my asshole starts to bleed when I think about entering a market sale during the squeeze, but, people will do it. 

So, I guess, wtf are you guys planning on doing? 

*I personally plan on selling 5% at 5k, to take my profit in case Kenny G decides to nuke the earth. Then, 5% at 10k, 10% 25k, and since I'm a multi-millionaire at that point, I'm holding for the rest of you retards. I'll try and sell the rest on the way down, but I want us all to get rich here.

"New short tactic, spread DD FUD","We all love reading DD. It gets our retarded ape brains juices flowing and the lurking shorts know this. Just be aware that we might see a bit of DD FUD this weekend and into the weekdays ahead. As you may have already seen, there has been a post circulating about the possibility that the shorts are the ones buying up all the call options up to 800 and to not buy shares as this will drive the price up and give the shorts leverage to slam the price down. That were the price is currently is the best price point to bleed the shorts. Great theory right? Other than the fact that stimulus checks are hitting accounts as we speak and we know that a lot of apes will be throwing those right into GME as soon as the market opens again. Not to mention the OP of this theory is asking everyone to ‚ÄúSPREAD THE WORD‚Äù to ensure that this gets into the screens of as many apes as possible. Long time apes likely won‚Äôt fall for it but we do have A LOT of newbies that have not been through the ups and downs of the share price and could easily fall for this FUD. Could March 19th be the day that sets GME off? Could be but it won‚Äôt be the end of the world if it doesn‚Äôt. Have you seen how well GME has done over the last 2 weeks!?! 19th or next month doesn‚Äôt matter, I will hold and buy more. What we do know is that a crazy amount of money will flow into GME over the next several days and shorts will do anything to stop it. This could be the major test for us apes as they try to infiltrate our community and slow down the inevitable.

3.13 GME Technical Analysis,"Hey, buttholes. 

*I'm not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. Don't gamble what you can't afford to lose and fuck the HFs.* 

Okay, now that that's out of the way I'm going to try my hand here at some technical analysis. This is mostly for me to practice and dig deeper into my own investment.

Something to keep in mind; this stock is super hyped and affected by news, emotion, sneaky fuckery, anger, happiness etc. Technical analysis will of course fall short in this kind of situation but this shit's fun and I like them green dildahs. 

Let's start with some feel-good vibes:

[The little engine that couldn't give a fuck](https://preview.redd.it/ntpmjc1hstm61.png?width=4194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7736e416d377d44396542b4a8e0e35a1709e606d)

Last week felt rough... but when you take a step back to the 3month view... it feels a bit tastier on the eyes. It's hard to step back when you really want shit to pop off and tunnel vision is in full swing and you're staring at 1m candles, but slow and steady gains are far more stable, albeit not as exciting to watch. 

Things you should know about me before believing anything I have to say: 

**Weaknesses**:

* New to trading/technical analysis
* Invested in GME and biased to our success
* Prone to excitement/addictive personality
* Been poor all my life so I'd really like this to work out

**Strengths:**

* Pretty logical (I think)
* Not a dumb dumb (I think)
* Generally skeptical
* Not afraid to admit I'm wrong/made a mistake

Basic info for my setup:

**Candles**: 1hr and 4hr

**Range:** Mid-Feb to present

**Indicators:**

[**RSI**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) **(16,14,24)**

Firstly, we'll look at the 4hr candles. Before we look at any indicators I want to get a lay of the land and get some gut feelings (real technical, I know). 

**2.18**: DFV testifies (then the sweet sweet boy doubles down

**2.24:** Ryan Cohen tweets his [ice cream/frog tweet](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1364650709669601289?s=20) ‚Äî this is important as this was after more than a month of silence. This boosted hype and kicked us into a steady climb out of 40 dollars. 

Hype builds from there, retail floods back

**3.8:** Gamestop taps Cohen to lead E-Commerce push ‚Äî shit explodes, FOMO starts kicking in, WSB seems happy about GME again, shit's awesome

Weeeee

**3.10:** HOLY SHIT WTF HAPPENED ‚Äî there is a shit ton of DD/Speculation on what took us from our peak to 172 but our quick recovery to a steady climb leads me to believe that this was big shorts doing their best to shake out them paper handed bitches and hurt momentum ‚Äî shit, I almost set stop losses after that but I'm a dipshit and decided to keep free ballin' it ‚Äî I really don't think this was anyone intentionally trying to trigger SSR. As seen by our last few days, SSR does not protect a stock enough to be a worthy risk and these fancy millionaires would know this. 

Through this period, the lack of news coverage and the sudden coverage when the stock dropped (and still closed up a healthy percentage) tells me that a) Big money is scared/trying to control the narrative b) retail and likely some whales (who still aren't on your side BTW) are holding on for them massive gains. 

**Present:** Right now, the volume is decreasing a bit (still higher than our low period in Feb) and we are consolidating around 260. Looks to me like we are watching big money on either side in a bit of brinksmanship until news/catalysts arrive. 

And many are coming or POSSIBLY coming:

* **3.19:** New DTTC [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzllyx/dtcc_document_posing_new_rules/)
* **3.23:** Earnings 
* **Next Weekish:** Stimmy checks 
* **3.19:** Controversial end game theory [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)
* **3.17: GME** [hearing](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407261) 
* **3.19:** XRT [rebalancing](https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51) 
* Ryan Cohen announced as SEO
* Acquisition/Partnership

**The Chart (4HR):**

[4hr, MACD, RSI](https://preview.redd.it/y9qv2ccqqum61.png?width=4194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e636bf27abb32334bc444bd1d8f5a1dcd37185d1)

**Support Levels:** 114ish, 250ish

**Resistance:** 280ish

**RSI:** Generally, we're seeing pretty sustained upward buying pressure on the RSI. Price action seems to follow RSI up around the 60s for much of this time period until Cohen is tapped to lead the e-commerce train. Then momentum swings up into overbought territory. The RSI seems to move with the larger trend upward leading into our current period of consolidation. 

I would address the anomaly on **3.10** ‚Äî¬†despite the HUGE swing, the price corrected itself quite well and continues its trend upward through with lower momentum and a healthy period of consolidation. I take this to mean that the majority of people holding this stock weren't shaken by the action and believe in the overall trend ‚Äî I won't speculate on why that happened, y'all can find other DD for that.

Healthy remember that this is a pretty short time period in an extremely volatile stock. I'm taking this all with a grain of salt.

I'm hoping to see the RSI to dip down into the 50s and level out combined with our price staying in this same general territory between 250 and 280 until a catalyst launches our dicks into space.

**MACD:**

Our signal line and MACD line are coming back together and still trading above zero. Our histogram is currently in a downtrend signaling to me that we're heading toward a correction in price to account for our jump from the mid-100s to the mid-200s. This isn't a sharp decline and may level out just fine  to ride parallel for a bit. 

**VOLUME:** We've seen some great gains in volume over the end of Feb to now, largely spiked due to catalysts previously mentioned, we've been able to ride that volume up to our current price point and volume Is dropping back down to previous levels of consolidation albeit with more selling volume than before ‚Äî I think our steady increase in price likely gave shorts a bit of a kick in the dick and they're working harder to keep the price down than before; this has certainly curbed momentum but not stamped it out. 

[BOLLINGER BANDS](https://preview.redd.it/u42607sewum61.png?width=4166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=772bc2cc429d8378427ae202ee5527af1598e00b)

I wanted to have a look at the trend from another lens so I popped on the Bollinger Bands. Notice how in our previous consolidation period, right before our huge breakout, late Feb, the bands contracted hard around the share price; implying lower volatility ‚Äî¬†but currently, that is not the case. 

This shit is a pressure cooker. This isn't the 4th-grade taekwondo spar, this is fucking Bruce Lee circling an opponent. Crazy eyes, shiny muscles, and quick bursts of attack to gauge the opposition. 

**Candledix:**

[Dildahs](https://preview.redd.it/mc1nhhddzum61.png?width=1004&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9db9d6fed1e6a6c47888c7c960e9a49195536fe3)

Lets have a look at them dildos for last week starting on the 8th. 

Starts out bullish as fuck. Each dildo as green as the last and opening/closing higher than the previous day. Rock hard and edging all the way to Wednesday ‚Äî I thought for sure it was gonna be a Peter North kind of finish but fuckin mom walked in without knocking and the share price scrambled to get its pants up and change the channel on the TV. 

After this paradigm shift we see the buyers fight admirably to pick the price up off the floor (our pants) and pull em all the way back up to around 285 only to settle at about 265. 

Then shit gets nervy and a bit boring. 

**3.12** we see equal dojis, battling with neither really winning

**3.13** we open higher and form what looks to be a shooting star Doji, signaling a possible bearish reversal as buyers have trouble returning to their peak. 

**4hr shart summarized:**

* I see no divergence between any of the indicators giving me no great fears of an unprompted drop/spike in price
* Volatility remains high, building pressure for an eventual breakout *(this works against the comfort provided by momentum indicators)*
* Retracing is bound to happen to a certain degree, though I think it won't drop below a weak resistance at 229ish 
* Shooting star doji help the argument of retracing coming up as does downward trends in MACD

**The Chart (1HR):**

I'll be looking to confirm or counter the patterns I see in the 4hr chart. 

[1hr chart, MACD, RSI](https://preview.redd.it/34vg40ir0vm61.png?width=4188&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7108c265c669cf5f04969851e495dca66ac84779)

First impressions:

* MACD red/Crossed under signal ‚Äî **confirms downward trend**
* Bollinger bands contracting (still nowhere near early Feb) **confirms volitility**
* RSI hovering at the previous level of consolidation periods ‚Äî **confirms consolidation**
* Candlesticks for Fri 3.12 have almost a hanging man pattern followed by a some buying support which was finally overtaken by some bearish engulfing action ‚Äî **confirms downward trend/Retracement**

**Having a look at the Bollinger bands, we are testing the mid line ‚Äî**¬†over the course of this time period we have yet to break below in a big way. I think last week may hev been enough to see us finally dip past the midline when I take these other bearish indicators into account and if you look at the lower line, around 238 currently, it sits right in the middle of the support trench I've drawn out between 230-250. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Predictions for 3.15-3.19:**

Ooooo tealeaf time. 

I believe we are in a very precarious duel. I think as we sit and spin waiting for a catalyst we'll consolidate between 229-300 with some big swings in both directions until the big old question mark at the end of the week. 

Tweets/Emotion-based catalysts have a huge impact and it's impossible to know which ones will help.hurt, though the big reactions to tweets seem to be waning as they become more regular.

I do think we have momentum building despite the haymakers the shorts landed last week and I don't see anything in my very green technical analysis that makes me worry for a big unprovoked drop. 

Will the squeeze happen next week?  No one knows, stop trying to pin a date.

Did the shorts cover? Who knows. Will DTCC rules nail the HFs? Don't know. Margin calls? Not sure. 

**Things I am sure about**: 

* We are in uncharted territory. We have no clue how this boom in retail investment will change the market forever (because it will) and due to that, unexpected and unprecedented action will be taken by the gov, big money, and the media ‚Äî¬†we have no idea if this will benefit the retail investor or not but the cards are stacked against us
* Rich people don't like to lose money and will do anything not to
* Poor people don't care about losing money because they have no money and when it's spent it's spent and this is better odds than the lottery
* The company's value is not currently reflected by the stock price as it's in a period of extreme transition ‚Äî this will be hard to judge until the roadmap/future plan for the company is made public 
* If 3.19 doesn't bring big gains, expect a huge fucking dip. Some will hold knowing that earnings are 3.23 ‚Äî if that doesn't provide big gains, it becomes a true question of how much value the company has moving forward, and how deep that fucking value is. 
* The big money thinks your stupid. They're kind of right but all of us who jumped in are educating ourselves via our peers. 

Good luck everyone, this is my first big technical analysis so if you have any thoughts, critique/concerns feel free to comment/downvote/shit on/upvote/correct. 

If it proves to be wildly misguided or incorrect I'll take it down. 

Cheers,

P.S. I hope that's a monster cup and handle.

Being Antifragile,"This was an incredible week for GME. We went from \~150 on Monday to \~270 in post-market on Friday. There‚Äôs no way to look at what happened and come away with anything other than good feelings about that. I‚Äôve now got more money in my brokerage account than I‚Äôve ever had before and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I have a larger bet on GME than I‚Äôm comfortable with. My GME holdings are both the stock (up over 100% this week) and a bunch of newly ITM options contracts (up \~500% this week.)

For me, the money got big enough that I‚Äôm now concerned about paper-handing in a panic, but my level-headed self is not interested in selling. Playing with money that really means something to me now, I know that I‚Äôm going to be more susceptible to market swings and disinformation, so I bought insurance. There‚Äôs a great quote from Nassim Taleb in his wonderful book *Antifragile* that goes something like ‚ÄúInsurance is much cheaper when the house isn't‚Äô on fire than when it is.

Buying OTM puts are my insurance policy. If the stock stays at its current level or rises, I‚Äôm going to have booked the biggest win of my life on this stock (hooray!) If all of the DD is wrong and the stock comes tumbling down (I don‚Äôt think it will) I make a boatload of money as those puts explode in value. Importantly OTM puts are *really* cheap right now, so I could cover all my long calls and equity positions with a small fraction of my initial investment. The important thing is that these put contracts are putting a bound on my downside risk while not inhibiting my upside at all. 

I made this play at about 2:00 on Friday and was overwhelmed with deep relief. I was no longer worried about when the next short attack would come, and I was satisfied that no matter what happens with the stock now, I‚Äôm going to have booked a giant win. Hell, I even stopped watching the ticker and got some work done-- something I haven't done in about a week. I‚Äôm strapped in and ready to go to the moon, but now I don‚Äôt have to worry about any sabotage from short sellers or even read any more of the DD and wonder ‚Äúis this real or is this disinformation?‚Äù

You can't lose if you don't play üíé‚úåÔ∏è HODL,"I have recently started to watch The Wire (again), amazing show, highly recommend, but that's for another sub.

Last night I watched the episode where Lieutenant Daniels wife gives him some advice regarding the political shit show that he's involved in at work, where no matter what he does he's fucked. 

""The game is rigged, but you cannot lose if you do not play""

Here is the clip:
https://youtu.be/K0omu7x_LbU

Coincidentally, just tonight I [read this lovely piece ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4agxj/hedge_funds_manipulated_the_market_since_forever/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) by u/Not_a_Deutscher. He explains how the whole game is controlled by algos that manipulate the market, calculate price triggers and ensure that they always win. 

What fucks them up is when they reach a dumb üêí who just sit here scratching his/her balls/foof and not letting go of üçå, no matter what the clever algorithm comes up with. Like the Sentinels from the Matrix, they can find me but their is fuckall they can do if I just don't move, I can just sit here smirking at them and pissing then off more and more each day, they hate me, I am shit on their shoe, and in this unique position where I can really piss them off by just doing nothing and smiling üòÑ.
 
The only thing they can do is more and more and more illegal shit, and at some point they are going to piss off other big dicks (if they haven't already). We are obviously in the game, but can choose to not participate in this particular bit.

So I will take Mrs Daniels and u/Not_a_Deutscher advice, HODL, HODL, HODL. The game IS rigged, but if we don't play (by algo rules), we can't lose.

"Apes, I love you all and I think there's something we need to think about.","Hey guys. So I've been thinking about something lately that I would like to bring to your attention and hopefully we can all discuss. I apologize in advance if the formatting is off, I'm writing this from my phone.

I'd like to talk about our current situation, the players and their roles, FUD/confirmation bias, and the media. Also, yhe potential for apes being fed unrealistic expectations, flattery and being outright manipulated and ultimately used.

I've recently thought about all this and since I haven't seen it being discussed, I'd like to lay out my thoughts as clearly as I can and maybe this can lead to a discussing among us.

I'd like to being by starting off with a question. Do you all think the hedgefunds that are long are really on our side? 

I read some DD earlier this week in which apes were speculating who could have made that huge sale of 1.5 - 2 million shares that were sold Wednesday when prices for GME soared to $340+. In the thread I believe the final conclusion was that the sale came from BlackRock who this sub has long speculated was ""on our side"".
From DD on this sub it was thought that the shorts had started a short attack and then the big sale of stock from the longs made it so the drop in price would also trigger GME being place SSR list for the following day which was supposed to help take us to the moon on Thursday and Friday right? Well we didnt moon but whoever sold the 1.5-2m shares made a fuck ton of money on the sale.

Lets assume the number shares sold was 1.75m. At a peak price of $344, it was a sale worth over $600m. This also enabled them to purchase options at a cheaper price which made them even more money. 

I know there are apes in here like myself who spend hours and hours reading DD on here. The popular ones with tons of likes comments and multiple awards so i know there's a good chance that you have seen the DD that I'm talking about. So I won't waste time looking up the links and posting them along with this write-up because I want to get this out there and it'll take me so much time to type this up as it is. 

Early last week when there was that small gamma squeeze after there was DD written talking about the hedge funds who are long potentially setting that up and also testing to see if there would be a massive sell-off once the price rise above $100, and they concluded we wouldn't sell so that we were to be trusted hold the line. 

Where I'm going with this is that I feel as though the hedge funds that are long are potentially trying to use us in order to enrich themselves and using the Apes as an anchor in order to do so. In the sub you will see that there are a ton of post saying ""hey don't sell anything until we hit 500K"" the sub is flooded with those kinds of posts and most of them get awarded and upvoted and have tons of visibility. It started with 10k then 69,420, then 100k, 500k, etc etc. 

What im wondering is, whats the possibilty that the the hedgefunds that are long are playing us to raise our expectations so they can drain the shorts before we ever hit those numbers that we want so badly? Along with 500k floor posts we also have posts that are telling us not to sell anything at any point. Those posts get upvoted and accepted. They make people get their calculators out and dream of seeing those numbers in their accounts. We dream of what our lives would be like if we hit it big. We dream of our families never having to want for anything. But what if this is just reverse FUD? What if the longs are doing this so they can make those sales, make returns and then buy for cheaper. They already know we wont sell, we've had this drilled into minds over and over. 

The other day I was on this sub and after seeing a multitude of these kinds of posts I started to feel like maybe we're being brainwashed and played to not sell so the longs can hit them over and over again while we sit around and not make money or have the ability to increase our positions. 

We read posts that say ""shorts have lost X-billions shorting GME"" We all get excited and say ""fuck you Melvin, thats what you get"" but none of us actually got a taste of that. Sure we see our portfolio grow but remmeber that those are unrealized gains. The longs are making bank and we're the anchor. Why would they tell us not to sell even a bit but at the same time tell us that retail doesnt move the market the way they do? If we dont make a difference why cant we sell some to make a bit of money for ourselves which we can use to pay bills or like me, reinvest into more shares when it dips.

I'm just starting to get suspicious of it all because its constant. Then we get the forbes article saying that we're sharp and doing great if not better research then hedgefunds. Im not saying it isn't true but what if that was planted to butter us up? We havent trusted the media thus far but whenever they write an article that seems positive, no one questions it. There's no one talking about the posibilty of us being played. 

What im starting to suspect is the longs are also in there with their shills convincing us to wait for 500k all the while they're playing us and draining the shorts therefore making it impossible to ever hit those numbers.  No one downvotes them or tells them to fuck off like we would the posts from obvious shills who are on the shorts side. 

They butter us up, reinforce the idea not to sell, cause spikes, they sell off and make money, it dips, they buy more shares and options and do it over and over again until Melvin and co are out of business. Mark Cuban said it was possible for us to hit them again and again but we cant if we never sell. 

This is starting to get long and I hope its making sense so ill just end it here. Lets think about all the players involved here and what could their game plan be. We know for sure that the hedgefunds that are long as not on ourside. They are shady predators just like the shorts are. And if you were them, how could you ensure to make yourself a fuck ton of money? Provably by gaming us the way the shorts have tried to do. 

I want you to know that I care about all the apes in here. I want the tendies and freedom just everyone else in here. Ive been amazed at the community we have created and how smart and thoughtful a lot of you are. This whole event has given me such a newfound excitement for life and I want the apes to protect themselves and make sure our lives are better after this. I dont want to get played here but I think theres a strong likelyhood that we are being manipulated and since they say what we want to hear, we arent catching it.

Don‚Äôt forget what you are fighting for here,"I saw a recent post in LinkedIn talking about blockbuster, all of the comments I saw were people reminiscing about the stores and how they felt going in there to rent movies, buying the snack foods and getting ready for a movie night at home.

We are seeing large sell order in resistance to the call option price points as they near expiration which drives the price down.  
Are they then buying the stock back in larger quantities once they drove price down. As long as the trade isn‚Äôt at a loss it wouldn‚Äôt be a wash sale.

I  decided to post this so other apes and newer apes can see that I trust  this fucking company and where it‚Äôs heading. But you might say, who the  fuck are you? Have you put the time to understand about what is going  on? The answer is a fucking yes.

The fucking minerals and other ingredients to make¬†üíéüôå¬†just fell on my palms and I embraced and thanked the opportunity to find this sub and great¬†ü¶ç¬†that are willing to give their DD.

I'll keep holding because it's all I have,"I posted the other day about how I'm currently homeless but have 1.59 shares of GME. I will admit, I'd kinda gotten on the hype of the squeeze happening this week, and my heart sank the day after my last post, because that's when everything went wild.

As it stands, my shares are worth a couple hundred. That money to me right now is pretty significant, but as I said in my last post, **I have nothing to lose.** I will HODL for as long as I can. Forever. I've literally lost everything these past 12 months, from my job, to my fiance, to my house, to my dog. They can short attack this thing all they want. They can publish their articles. Set the media against the apes. Whatever. When I say I have nothing, I mean it. This isn't even about me getting rich, this is literally survival for me at this point. I know we shouldn't put all our eggs in this basket, and I know for a lot of people this is just about sticking it to the hedge funds with play money, but this whole ordeal started when I was at my lowest, and it's pretty much what keeps me going right now. This is ALL I have.

Today was an interesting day!

It started off with a surgical strike to get on the SSR list again for tomorrow, then bringing the stock back up within 15 minutes to the day's open price!

After that, it just seemed like a boring day, right? **WRONG!** 

All of today's ups and downs were **very well calculated to ensure the stock was never overbought, but continued to force those betting against the stock to bleed their reserve shares without letting the price go too low to let them buy more at a discount** (I mean look at that PERFECT VWAP line \[purple line\].

A reminder, when a stock is on the SSR list, it can only be shorted on the upticks (i.e., when the stock is increasing in value). **This does not mean you cannot sell actual stock that you own,** but that means you have to actually own stock, **not just borrow someone else's**.

This means, that if an institution wants to **deflate the price**, they have to **already own shares** and then **sell them**. Those betting against the stock would already own a lot of stock for this exact purpose (probably purchased when it was sub $100), with the hopes that they can **keep the price down until they can short it again the next day**. However that plan went down the drain once **GME hit the SSR limit as they need to make those shares last TWO days.**

&amp;#x200B;

When you look at the data below, you can see that GME never goes above 70 on the RSI band ([Click Here to learn about RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)), meaning the **stock was never overbought.** Instead it just slowly rises to the 70 and then eases off (I'm sure a very expensive program does this). 

&amp;#x200B;

If it went too high, there is a risk it could rebound and drop the price, allowing short sellers to buy up cheap shares to refill their supply. GME hit the 70 mark 6 times today, but it only hit the 30 mark three, (ie oversold), since short sellers were just slowly selling shares as needed to keep the price flat and trying to not exhaust their supply. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only time it went outside this band was during the last 5 min when they tried to bring down the price, but you can see that corrected very quickly before the day ended, and it went right up to $260 the second the market closed!

**What I believe happened today was institutions bleeding dry the short sellers of their reserve shares so that tomorrow they will have a reduced ability to stop the rally.** Think of this as a Zergling rush before you storm the base.

\---------- **So what will happen tomorrow?** 

I think the same institution that got GME onto the SSR list today will try to do it again. They will get the stock down in premarket again and very quickly hit the 10% SSR. This would mean 3 full days of no shorting. 

If this happens, it could be another 'slow day' of letting the shorts bleed the rest of their reserve stock, with probably the first push in the last hour or two to get as many of the options in the money before the market closes.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------- **TLDR** 

**Today was intentionally a flat day to make short sellers bleed their reserve stock so they have less when the real gamma squeeze happens in the next day or two. Strap in for the ride** üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

üëèüèª Analysis: The real game boys grab 677 percent,"Really good article about $GME short squeeze written by THE CHART MAN üë® üìà

Link to the article [HERE ](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-03-11/Analysis-The-real-game-boys-grab-677-percent-YxYV5YQkBW/index.html)

Copy: 

Editor's note: Daryl Guppy is the author of eight books on trading financial markets and appears regularly on CNBC Asia and is known as ""The Chart Man"". The article reflects the author's opinion, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

The GameStop phenomenon is a zombie which will not go away. GameStop is back from the dead again with another jump of 173 percent in five days. This follows a 312-percent raise over two days in late February to make a total 677-percent rise in less than three weeks. 

It looks like market participants learned little from the last GameStop episode. 

The old market axiom tells us that a fool and his money are easily separated. What the axiom does not tell us is that the separation is usually managed by finance industry professionals. The continued astounding activity around the U.S.-listed GameStop suggests that as a result of technology, this relationship may have changed.

During the first sharp rally in early January, the vested interests in the finance industry all called ""You'll be sorry"" to these traders. It was a desperate taunt designed to cover their own industry failings as several professional hedge funds struggled against the activity of so-called amateur traders. This group of amateurs turned sophisticated industry tools against the professionals who were accustomed to using the same tools exclusively for their own benefit.

It was not a one-off. 

The hedge funds were ""caught short"" and had to buy GameStop stock to cover their obligations. This is called a ""short squeeze"" and the result is simple. The first January price rally cost the hedge funds $20 billion. To make matters worse, the hedge funds had to buy GameStop stock from the amateur traders to cover their short positions and the amateurs were not willing sellers. The result was a dramatic price rise from $88 to $380.

The same game is in play again with a 677-percent rise from $44.70 to $350 because some fools have not learned. But just who are the fools?

The hedge funds don't like to be made to look foolish, so in February, they called for industry assistance. The solution was to stop amateur retail traders from trading GameStop for one day. Market observers were treated to the ugly sight of a hedge fund brawl, which resulted in a very volatile daily price move, low to high, of 76 percent. These game boys reset the playing field and readjusted the entry points for the new trade.

Will they try this tactic again? The first rescue attempt is under investigation by regulators, so it's unlikely this particular cavalry tactic will ride to the rescue a second time. 

When retail trading in GameStop resumed in January, the smart amateurs took a short trading position. Many of the hedge funds, still smarting from the ""short squeeze"", also took new short positions around $350. The objective for all players was to trade the expected market retreat from $350 to $60 or even lower.

This is the game hedge funds play. These professional investors ""attack"" a company by preparing an analysis report that suggests the company is not as profitable as it says publicly. This can be a valuable service because it flushes out companies that are falsifying their financial performance. 

It becomes a corrupted service when those responsible for the report also take a ""short"" position in the stock prior to the release of the report, which is designed to drive the price of the stock lower. There is good money to be made from this game tactic that many believe verges on market manipulation.

The strategy depends on hedge funds consolidating money from multiple individual investors and applying it in a single large sale trade. The counter-strategy used by amateur traders is a swarm attack where individuals operating independently of each other but with a common purpose are able to overwhelm the target. This swarm attack is a wave of largely uncoordinated action. 

Hundreds of individual investors pushed up the price of GameStop in January, and it is happening again. It is a mistake to dismiss as fools redux because these amateurs outsmarted the professionals in January, and they may do it again. What was started by a small group who deliberately challenged the hedge funds expanded when other traders independently saw the price rise and joined the trade. 

Then the professional traders joined, shorting those they believed were fools. The biggest gamers in the market are the institutions. They set up the game, define the rules, and like any gambling house, take a cut. 

The key lesson that should have been learned from GameStop is that hedge funds must be careful about whom they invite to the game. GameStop shows that retail traders can no longer be treated as cannon fodder for the market.

The amateurs are again flexing their muscles with the 677-percent price rise. Time will tell if the hedge funds have learned anything from those they disparage as fools.

Oversimplified ELI5 as to what tf is happening for newbies,"oversimplified ELI5 explanation

Hedge funds thought the stock would go down. They BORROWED shares, and sold them at say $10. Now the price is going up, and they need to buy at much higher prices, say $250, incurring a $240 loss (-2400% return), in order to return the shares to where they borrowed them from.

They are using all the influence they have to make this stock go down, but apes are still holding, thanks to this subreddit. r/GME and r/Wallstreetbetsnewü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶çü¶ç

HFs pay interest every day for the shares they borrowed (which is very expensive for several reasons), so at a certain point they will have to decide to cut their losses, buy shares in order to return them (‚Äòcover their short‚Äô). Buying the shares will increase the share price, which will force other shorters to do the same, driving the price to insane heights, rather fast. This is what you call a short squeeze. It is very likely to occur since there are A LOT of short sellers, I‚Äôve heard speculations up to as high as 900% (this they would require 9 shares for every 1 share than actually exists) ; any of these numbers has the potential to turn this into the greatest short squeeze in history, a NYSE supernova if you will. üöÄüí´üöÄüí´üöÄüí´üöÄüí´üöÄüí´ Also factors like a gamma squeeze may accelerate this, but that's harder to explain. You may have heard the $100k per share figure around, and it is most certainly possible.

This is not financial advice, and you'll have to decide for yourself, but it may be worth buying whatever small amount of GME shares you can afford to lose, and enjoy the ride/show without fearing volatility.

Transferring out of RH FOMO," 

I know I'm retarded and blah blah, hate on me for having RH for so long, but I couldn't take it anymore scheming of ways RH could fuck me out of my tendies... Thought of one or two where citadel grabs RH by the balls in the classic ""I go down you go down with me""/ ""better you than me"". Thinking of the hearing the other month on how easily citadel threw RH under the buss and washed their hands..Anywho, I initiated a transfer to another broker today.

I know its for the best, and I never really had doubts but now FOMO is hitting me HARD! Realistically, there are more dates we need to hit (next hearing, quarterly earnings, etc), the new rules don't take place until 10 days from tomorrow that puts hedgies on their heels. I know it will take days to peak, and the sheer number of shorts will drag this out longer than other squeezes....but I'm half tempted to call up first thing tomorrow and telling them to cancel the transfer. I thought this would put me at ease but I am STRESSING. The thought of loosing so much of my initial investments is horrifying... If I lose it because the sqozening fails or whatever. Fine, I'm cool with it.... But to invest so much then lose it because I can't touch my shares and WATCHING IT?!?! FREAKIN OUT a lil

&amp;#x200B;

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday.  The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

&amp;#x200B;

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting us on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said we weren't just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it was just another headfake, y'all.  The writer was framing US as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

&amp;#x200B;

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES,  are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

&amp;#x200B;

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.  

&amp;#x200B;

NOBODY says or does anything about it.  Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress.  The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors.  They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

&amp;#x200B;

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired.  I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips.  I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

&amp;#x200B;

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car.  (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further)  And since  I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either.  So YA, Momma wants a car.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

&amp;#x200B;

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims.  ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

&amp;#x200B;

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME???  My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market.  The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

&amp;#x200B;

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life!  And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY. 

&amp;#x200B;

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

&amp;#x200B;

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out.  But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to ride the rapids.  To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming.  Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie.  That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

&amp;#x200B;

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view.  I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer.  Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

First question : Last time people also thought it would go up to from anywhere between 1000 and 100k. Why will this be any different? What ended the last squeeze anyway?

March 19th looks to be a very important date for call options, as the call options for the weeks after that date are a literal fraction of the 19th. Does this mean that the squeeze is going to happen or start on the 19th? Or atleast ROCKET on that date? Does it take a couple of days after March 19th for the Market maker's ""finding"" the shares to affect the market?

Answering these questions would really help reassure new investors, which of course helps things happen. Thank you for the insight.",GME,Mychelly360,22.0,1,2021-03-07,ok questions question time people thought k different ended squeeze march th looks important date options options weeks date literal fraction th does mean squeeze going happen start th atleast rocket date does couple days march th market makers finding shares affect market answering questions help reassure new investors course helps things happen thank insight,127.0

DOUBLE YOUR GME EXIT PRICES APES!!!,"This serves some purposes (dumb ape need smart ape help with numbers):

69: The longer we collectively hold, the higher the price goes. It‚Äôs simple ape logic and something we are all well versed in. 

420: When estimating your exit price you MUST calculate for capital gains taxes or you will screw yourself out of this once in a lifetime experience. Depending on how much you profit, you‚Äôre gonna be paying Uncle Sam (or Daddy Thor, Mommy Merkel, Great Great Great Great Great Grandma Elizabeth, or wherever tf you‚Äôre from) anywhere from 30-50% of whatever you make. Therefore if you‚Äôre exit price is $5k, in the end you may only make $2,500k per share after taxes. 

100: this number reflects the percentage of my ass the HFs need to be prepared to eat. 

TL;DR Double your exit price, expectations, shares of GME, and number of crayons ingested daily. That is all.

"My DD, based on sentiment. The lottery play.","Let me start by saying, I‚Äôm not the smartest person. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent though. And you‚Äôll agree with that statement if you feel someone with multiple degrees, and earning more than $250k per year is intelligent. Now that I‚Äôve tooted my own horn, let‚Äôs continue to the DD. 

We have lottery tickets. Any stock is a lottery ticket. But how much is it worth? Therein lies the rub. It‚Äôs worth what you believe it‚Äôs worth. Back in Feb, I believed it was worth 1.5k a share. That‚Äôs why I bought more lottery tickets. 

Now, I didn‚Äôt sell my entire position in the past few weeks, because I don‚Äôt believe these tickets I‚Äôve bought are only worth $37k altogether. 

Smart and influential people have been saying that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing because not everyone can with the lottery. I bet to differ. 

I‚Äôve bought 149 lottery tickets (as far as you know). It‚Äôs a bet. I‚Äôm ok if I lose all that money. But here‚Äôs what I think they‚Äôre worth:

10 tickets are worth $500 each. 
50 tickets are worth $1,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth $2,000 each 
10 tickets are worth $5,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth $7,000 each. 
20 tickets are worth $10,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth in between 10k-40k
10 tickets are worth $50k
10 tickets are worth $100k
8 tickets are worth &gt;$100k. 
1 ticket is priceless. 

That goes to my future child. It is a lesson: Money will come and go. Presidents will change. Climate will change. Things will be great. Things will be awful. The only constant is you, and your mind. Invest in yourself, success will follow. 

So that was my Sunday morning hangover rant. Now that I‚Äôve read it over myself, it does sound like I think I‚Äôm amazing. Whatever. I don‚Äôt give a fuck, I am amazing. We‚Äôre ALL fucking amazing.

Calling fellow GME apes and boffins: I need your help to piece together a complete timeline of events for GME üìÖü¶çüöÄ,"**This is an extension of** [**my previous post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxu6nf/i_created_a_webpage_to_draw_attention_to_the_gme/) **about** [**https://gmetruth.com**](https://gmetruth.com/)

Thanks to everyone who added to the conversation over on the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxu6nf/i_created_a_webpage_to_draw_attention_to_the_gme/) \- as promised I've made some changes and updates to the site which were requested by you guys - I also received a lot of emails about referencing/indexing, so I've added that in too. Site traffic is increasing daily and is now ranking on Google for the following search terms:

**Top Hit:** gme truth, truth gme, the truth about gme, the truth gme

**3rd Page:** gamestop the truth

*Not bad for 3.5 days, ideally we want the site to rank top for 'gamestop the truth' so that anyone who gets wind of foul play and whom doesn't already know about what's been going on will see this before the 30 other bogus mainstream media articles that claim ""we (the people of Reddit) are the problem"".*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

You might be wondering why I've started a new thread...

The next step I'm undertaking is to **formulate a timeline of events to challenge the narrative which is being presented in the mainstream media**. As an example [check out this website](https://timeline-of-failure.com/) which was created last year to illuminate the UK's Conservative party's mishandling of Coronavirus - the plan is to build something similar (albeit more detailed) which provides a visual timeline of events relating to GME.

There are a few parts to this, first and foremost the data, it needs to be **high quality DD** ([I love rocket](https://gmetruth.com/rocket.html) jokes as much as the next internet sleuth, but integrity is important here). Obviously there are threads including [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj1wqv/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/) which I will pour through over the next few weeks, the same goes for any posts on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) / [r/Wallstreetbetsnew](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/) that have valuable insight. As with the homepage, once this timeline is collated and built I will share the site here again and ask for feedback so that our collective understanding is fully accounted for and any mistakes can be flushed out. *Unlike the media, our version of events will be factual.*

# What I need from my fellow apes:

**#1 Information/Facts and Opinions:**

There are likely things that are not covered in these threads that need to be brought to light. There will no doubt be things that have got lost in all the other DD that I personally am not aware of (*you don't know what you don't know*). There are likely posts that were good DD a few weeks ago but are now maybe not as true as we thought, maybe things are actually more implicating for those with short positions and this may affect how the information reads as part of a timeline.

**Any/all information you provide on this thread will be read and factored into the timeline, my fellow apes opinions and expertise are valued.** ü¶çü¶ç ü¶ç

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 Reach:**

The further this information gets the better it is for our individual prospects in this stock that we all like so much. Obviously the chances of this being picked up by the mainstream media outlets is low as it directly conflicts what they have been reporting, so **viral exposure on social networks (especially outside of Reddit) are the best places to share this webpage**. *If we can get traction through comments in threads like WSB, WSBN etc that would be great because getting a post passed AutoMod over there is like drawing blood from a stone.* üòÇ

&amp;#x200B;

**Thread Rules:**

\- In the interest of establishing a timeline of real events, please refrain from exclaiming things like **400% SHORT INTEREST** unless you have a statistical justification which stands to reason;

\- Please **don't make assertions that will be difficult to describe concisely** (it's going to be a lot of information anyway so I'm not looking to write a novel for each point/date) - I'll be including a maximum of a few paragraphs per date, *except for significant dates like when they turned the game off because they were losing*;

\- Please **include a relevant date with your post** so that I can tie it into the timeline accordingly;

\- Where possible please **link to data, charts, technical analysis, timelines between events** and anything relevant that happened in-between;

We Won,"Some critics and skeptics may murmur their rote-memorized counter-arguments, but that's just the sound of a losing battle playing out in their minds. They're coming to terms with the fact that deep down, this absurd spectacle looks... Pretty fun. Maybe a bit promising. Maybe they can make a quick buck buying dips and selling high, we're all morons to suggest otherwise after all.

As for the skeptics, sure. Some retail holders may need money right this minute, may have dug themselves into a hole they desperately need out of, took out a loan or what have you, and have no choice but to sell insignificant numbers of shares in the grand scheme of things. Or as GME rises out of their price range, they begin to see viable plays in stocks that are dropping in prices. Companies they may never have a chance like this to get in on before our new elite dump their earnings in and fire off smaller rockets all over the marketspace. Personally, my GME Gift shop exit strategy includes at least one bag to hold forever, but I'm bullish on the sentiment that I know how to hustle and at least one Elite Ape is hiring in the near future, and pays better than my current boss. But beyond that....

**NO ONE IS SELLING.**

I have no way of knowing if hedge funds have any more sneaky tricks to kick the can down the road. For all I know that dancing line is a visual representation of Melvin getting punted back and forth by warring Giants while gleeful WSB pros compete with each other to rip as big a chunk of shares out as they can, and will brag and boast and ""grats and Fuck you"" each other a few months down the road while us apes scamper about grabbing tendie crumbs that fall to main streat. Maybe the top tier players skillfully keep the MOASS from launching, I'm never going to care about investment or gambling enough to find out, I thought I was setting a wad of cash on fire because I was mad and heard a funny sea shanty meme.

What's the floor? What's the stock actually worth? I certainly don't know. This is not financial advice but my bias confirms that a GME is worth at least an AMZN some day. So why should I sell?

Well, let me put on my skeptic hat and tell you why.

**Because I haven't spent a month or more walking through hell with you. I just got here. I have no idea who you are. I don't know what a DD is, I have no idea how to navigate this weird website, none of your jokes or lingo make any sense to me. What's a shill, what's a hedge, what's a bot, what's a tendie, what's a reddit?**

Wow that hat was pretty upset, I'm taking it off now. Thanks to our apelike tendency to grab hold of any shiny new thing they see and run rampant with it, then shriek at anyone who tries to take our new toys away, the original meaning of our lingo may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Or old-timers who never listened in the first place. To clarify

**BOT**

A script (Python I believe is most common) that allows one user to fully or semi-automate interaction with Reddit using one or more reddit accounts. Type 69 in a sentence and a bot will likely reply to your comment. ""69? Nice"" users replying ""Good Bot"" or ""Bad Bot"" will summon a bot that maintains scores for bots. There are GOOD bots and there are BAD bots, just like my history is full of GOOD posts and BAD posts. Learning is fun. But they are all piloted by users.

Here are some resources. Also, Bottiquette is a word that is real and that amuses me.

**SHAREHOLDER**

(That's most of us, and hopefully you soon too, friend!)

Someone who has owns a portion of a company. GameStop is yours, you own it. Some of you own so many portions of this company that from where I am, you look like you belong at a desk in an office or something, whereas I'm a loyal fan or something. Or I'm a professional GME sign-spinner, I may have just slipped on my entry level GME dress-code compliant hat. But since this share doesn't currently pay dividends, we own it because we believe it is worth more later than it is now, and disagree with an ever shrinking audience.

SHILL: One who poses as a satisfied customer or an enthusiastic gambler to dupe bystanders into participating in a swindle. How do you know if someone is a shill or not?

You don't and you can't, and we are awesome (and representing our company, hoping to encourage its growth through the sale of either shares or sweet loot from stores), so we assume everyone is honest though possibly confused and lost and in need of direction.

We can very safely assume this because the hedge fund elites who have been a pain our ass for what feels like an eternity are unable to break character. What are they going to do, buy more? Lololol ahem sorry represent company.

Sure, someone may be here to sell you a pump-and-dump because you're a moron. No worries, like I said, lost and confused, and potentially a customer. Show him how intelligent you are with helpful answers to questions, links to DD, or.. I guess just silence? silence is pretty excusable honestly, hard to talk to every single person when you're in the middle of a multi-national rave party, running around talking to people from other sides of the planet. Pick a random person out of the half million subscribers we have, ask them ""hey what's outside?"" Chances are it's like a cool bird or a cityscape or something. Sorry, pump-and-dump guy, I'm very distracted. (Alternatively ask shills for music or something lololo AHEM sorry)

Someone might be using a bot. That's within the rules of the website. Unless they spam, in which case you report them and say please stop spamming. Or they say something rude, then you say derogatory language is against this subs rules and make a joke to show mean words don't hurt your feelings anymore. Or just say bad bot if they're really boring.

There's no more fight! We have won. Let's have fun. If you're scared, say so, a ton of us have been there. Post why you're here! I've been inspired by posts from people who have struggled through more than I ever have, and the fact that they're still moving forward means I can still move forward.

Center stage is very much not my thing and I can feel my composure slipping. I'd much rather spin my GME sign off stage, but let me do my best to larp the higher ups and wrap this up.

Why awareness is more important now than ever,"Disclaimer: English isn't my first language. Sorry if this is a pain to read.

Media suppression, WSB corruption, FUD and shill articles are quite a pain in the ass. As of writing, WSB has 9.4 million members. Of all the posts on the hot page, including the comments, you don't see that much of ""100k minimum"" as seen on this sub. As it has been said many times before, WE set the price, so theoretically 100k is possible (and beyond), however if we want this to actually happen - people must spread the word, and I'm not implying market manipulation (looking at you, interns).

Thanks to Uncle Bruce's newfound popularity amongst retail investors, the fact that he CAN be bought out by HFs and the fact that a large amount of people take his advice and trust what he says, as well as the fact that the majority of people over on WSB are thinking about paperhanding @ 1k, I believe that reaching 100k will be hard. In order for us to achieve a milestone such as this one, the people MUST know that 1k is chump change compared to what is possible. This sub only has 163k members and I don't think that reaching anything above 20k is possible seeing how most of the folks from WSB as well as institutions will most likely be closing positions @ 5k - 10k p/s. Then again, I am not a financial advisor, I have no idea how any of this works, GME go brrr, stock go green, ape get banana.

TL;DR: I believe that [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) doesn't have the sheer amount of holding power necessary to reach 100k$+. WSB normies will paperhand their shares way earlier which will in turn tank the price and prematurely stagnate the MOASS.

Why 100k is not outrageous (for HODLers),"People who consider this number outrageous always assume that every share covered by hedges will be covered at this price. Its highly likely that most shorts will have been margin called by then and covered below 100k, but there will still be some left to cover from the largest institutions with the deepest pockets. So, 100k isnt a meme because people assume that everyone will be able to sell there, which would cost 70 trillion. Rather, most will sell for less than that, freeing up capital for the DTCC and deep-pocketed funds to pay apes what they deserve, upwards of 100k.

Questions on $GME,"My position: 52 shares at average $269

So with the weekend ~~coming up~~ now passed and the usual DD's turning to memes, I instead have some questions I'm hoping apes might be able to answer.

1. **This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!** But this whole thing started when GME was overshorted in the expectation that it was going to go bankrupt.  Couldn't it technically happen again if some other stupid hedge fund(s) decided to overshort some other stock?  Or is there more that I'm missing that led to this perfect storm of GME?
2. **GME shorted stocks with fail-to-delivers.** So my understanding this far is that shorted stocks with fail-to-delivers have x days to find a stock before they \*must\* deliver.  However, no such thing is happening   Leading some to believe that hedge funds are simply shorting more stock to make up for the shorted fail-to-delivers.  Are we essentially waiting on someone to recall the stocks or for someone to say ""hey these are a lot of shorted stocks"" and demand the shorts to pay up?  Or what are we waiting on to happen (the ""trigger"" for the rocket, as it were)?
3. **Stock purchasing when there's no more stocks to give.**  So the stocks are shorted to shit and back, yet people keep buying them.  Are we saying that there's no flag in the system somewhere that says ""no more stocks to give""?  That, technically speaking, people could continue buying stocks even if there are no more of a particular stock, driving the price up of any stock to infinity?
4. **Finra ownership**.  So there were DD's earlier posting equity ownership in GME from FINRA.  Now I have a ROTH IRA with Fidelity where my stocks are owned, where would that show up?  Would it be listed under Fidelity, or would I show up as an individual investor?
5. **Retail is in control vs just along for the ride.**  I've seen this one go back and forth multiple times and I'm not sure which one to believe anymore.  Is retail currently in control of the price to hold forever or could we get fucked over by some company deciding to sell millions of shares at some peak, ensuring that the rocket comes crashing down around us?

I've had this sitting in drafts for 2 days now in case I came up with any other questions, but most of them would usually get answered by some other post XD

Their greatest fear is not losing money,"These people are so beyond rich, it won't matter much, especially since they have come ahead and squirreled away their assets in fake divorces, gifts to kids and packaged the upcoming losses in neat little shell companies. Sure one or two majors are going down, but only the people on the lower rungs of the ladders there will be materially affected.

Their greatest fear is not that. Certainly not legal consequences either, America is a true Banana Republic where money gets you out of anything. 

What they are actually afraid of is what peasants like us might do with millions. They are afraid of a tidal wave of philanthropic endeavours beyond 0.00034% of ones net worth. They are afraid of millionaires and billionaires happily paying taxes to give back to their communities and absolutely worst of all: freeing up time and resources to get politically active, involved and heard. 

Can you imagine? People with almost equal financial pull suddenly working to close those gaps and loopholes? People with money actually working towards fair wages, social programs for all, rehabilitation instead of punishment, decriminalization of drugs, free education and worst of all: an actual fair start to everyone as best as possible? 

You need go realize that money is more than yachts and houses and paying off pornstars to keep quiet about your shortcomings. 

Money will give you time and your words weight to add to a political discourse. They are scared out of their minds because each and everyone of us is heading towards freedom from wage slavery and modern serfdom. This, from their perspective, is a slave rebellion.

Once you have status, time and freedom, you can tirelessly work towards the change the world needs. Get active on climate change, workers rights, education, health care, social programs, demilitarization of police, research, international cooperation, changes to the legal and political system to root out corruption and hardening then against future attacks. 

Don't stop at looking out for your friends and family financially. The absolute most empowering result of the GME Moass will be a sudden influx of highly educated, motivated, idealistic, YOUNG professionals entering the political discourse in earnest. 

The most valuable asset you will gain from your gains will be your time and the freedom to use it for the benefit of others. 

This has the same political potential as emancipation.

Pick a topic, any topic, and donate some of your newfound freedom to coming generations by getting politically active for the betterment of all. Don't just hope your financial donations will be all that is needed. Charitable organizations have been around for a very long time. And while they do a lot of good, mostly they treat symptoms and are incapable to address the causes that make them necessary. You however will be able to go out and change what needs go be changed.

"Understanding SSR, from a sleep deprived apes view - Theory inside","Understanding SSR, from a sleep deprived apes view - Theory inside 


**First off, I have no stock market experience, everything you are about to read is pure speculation and should not be taken as financial advice, it doesn't mean anything apart from something that I haven't been able to shake out of my head for the last few days, having read much of the great DD over the last couple weeks movements, many of which also reflect on what happened in the days before to interpret just wtf happened on certain days**


Hi all fellow apes, I'm going to first start with a caveat - I am new to trading with gme being my first stock investment, however I am no stranger to FUD and market sentiment as I traded a little crypto in the early days (and fell for it many times), back then there were plenty of amateurs who just didn't have an idea of how big players assess and look at certain situations in order to make money. (Don't get me wrong, I was one too, shit I still am an amateur but I moved away from trading as it just eats your life looking for every single good or bad catalyst there may be coming up.) 


I have noticed a lot of people in the daily chat over the last few days wish and hope for gme to get on the SSR list, so first I'm going to explain what the SSR list is (feel free to correct me if I am wrong)


**What is the SSR**


The SSR is essentially a list of stocks that have fallen in value by 10% from the previous days closing price, say $NFWD (New-fone_Who-Dis) was at $10 closing price yesterday, and today it opens and falls to $9.09 (edit: math mix up, it's $9.09, I previously had $9) or below (10% or more), this means that that stock is now placed on the SSR list for both the rest of today, but also until closing tomorrow. 


**Why was it introduced?**


Well, quite a lot of us were around for the 2008 financial crisis, right? Do you remember the scene from the big short, towards the end when the character Mark Baum finds out that Morgan Stanley has taken heavy loses, and that his whole credit default swaps profits may go up in smoke because they will essentially go onto Morgan Stanleys books should Morgan Stanley go under...what does he decide to do, short the BANKS stocks and wait (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WUGhteNlzM - finds out Morgan Stanley is in deep trouble, followed by the discussion with his team at 2.30 onwards - both are very important to understand what I'm about to say)


What may have accelerated the banks failure and thus a government bailout could be the drastic falling of share price, which was falling for a reason yes, but if you were a whale, who wasn't exposed, why wouldn't you continue shorting it into the ground on the way down, thus making the tumbling price tumble faster and faster as short sales where taken the whole way down, whilst this may or may not have happened, it is for such an example as this that in 2010 the SEC reintroduced the SSR, so that short sellers couldn't escalate a tumbling share price even if the writing was on the wall, in this example it is to slow a downtrend, and in my opinion to help normal investors get out, rather than allow short sellers to crush their value before they get a chance to...it draws out the tumbling of a stock to give people rather than short sellers a chance (this is fully up for debate, there are other reasons also which I'm sure someone will point out, essentially though its to limit a very sharp decrease in price and cause an all-out panic...now get this...the SSR isn't a new concept, it existed before but a pilot was ran in 2004 to remove it to see if the market would work without it but I'm not going down that rabbit hole today to see who or why it was, after this pilot it was indeed removed though.


**""OK...so why are you telling us all this???""**


Well the main reason I started this was because there are numerous people in the last few days in the daily chat coming out with ""I hope it drops it to x today so its on the SSR, then price will go up"", now I agree that we have seen this in action ourselves, who in their right mind would be selling on (relatively) small upticks over the course of a few hours...that's right, the shorts who do not want momentum to grow and grow and thus the prophecy may come true...you have to remember, these guys got to where they are by not panicking, when the market moves against them they simply adapt to benefit from it, however if they cannot benefit then it is all disaster recovery, and I believe that is what we are seeing by trying to kick the can down the road and ensure that they might have a chance to remain solvent at the end of all of this, but IMO that doesn't appear to be an outcome now there are others coming in as blood is in the water, as evidenced from last week's fight on Wednesday before closing when the price went from $40 to $90+


**Before the $40 - $90 increase**


What did we see before the 24th when the price was increased? Let me tell you, on the 22nd the price closed at $46 even, the next morning on the 23rd, between 9.30 and 9.45 860k shares were traded. ¬†Now this isn't anything of note, its only 860k right? Wrong, this pushed the price beneath the 10% SSR threshold to $40.50 (or maybe slightly below, check the charts to confirm for yourself, look at the 1 or 5 min charts, the 860k figure is from the 15min charts for my own ease of how many short were traded quickly...I don't want to go growing any more brain wrinkle than required).


Now I want you to look at between 9.45-10.00 on the 23rd, 771k shares were immediately bought back...may this have been a tactic from a whale who knows what they are doing or coincidence...maybe they stopped liking the stock before they realised that they actually really really like it and wanted it back...


Now, as this happened on the morning of the 23rd, the SSR rule would have been triggered for that day, AND the entirety of the following day until close on the 24th, meaning all that was needed to occur, was a sustained push at any point during that day to bring the price up (remember, once in SSR short sales can only occur on the uptick, not downwards), this was done in the last hour as we all seen and probably quite a few retail jumped on too now that there was life showing in the old girl once again, I held mine and was lucky enough to accidentally almost double my small position just before this, it was by pure accident and I did not foretell anything was about to happen...I literally borrowed money off my girl as an advance for a bonus that was coming in on Friday, 2 days later.


**""There better be a point you're trying to get at here""**


Ok, you've read this far now, or others haven't and have went straight to the comments to lambast me for not knowing wtf I'm talking about, that's cool, I really don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm going to theorize now.


There was no need to trigger the 130 calls so early in the week, just as there was no need to trigger the SSR early in the week, there is just no justification to expend that type of ammo doing so for no real gain, we've seen sustained prices of $100-$120 for the last 5 days now, with $120 being the last 3 days approx. ¬†Now if I was a short, I wouldn't want to get suckered into the same trap that was set last week, but I also don't want it to hit $130 for a sustained period as it then places 130 calls ITM which as we know, can trigger a gamma squeeze, especially given the low liquidity we know is there by seeing half of February.


**Drumroll**


What if tomorrow, there isn't so much as a fight upwards, but roles are reversed and shorts attempted to keep the price at $124.50 (today's  closing price), whereas whales try to get it down to $112.05 - a 10% drop on the previous days close, which triggers the SSR for the rest of that day and also until close on Friday 5th, when this week's options are due to expire, in my view the shorts would have to expend every short position they could to fight against the rise to $130, they cannot short the price downwards, once those calls are ITM, then MM's will do one of 2 things, buy up shares thus increasing the price even higher, making shorts now fight on 3 fronts (retails, MM's covering calls, potential whale on the other side of them), and that could be game over for them (however let's not rule them out just yet, as we know we've underestimated them in the past here and who knows what could happen next week), or MM's might decide to just use this special privilege that they have (that I don't understand fully) to write even more naked shares in order to cover ITM calls which may be triggered...and thus the powder keg gets even more explosives added to it for down the road.


**Further points of interest**


Look at SPY and the VIX for today and yesterday...potentially actors taking coming out of some long positions to fight this battle for the squeeze, or my imagination gone wild?


I look forward to people telling me that I've missed out ""this"", or I'm not considering ""that"", this is just my thoughts and I look forward to learning for any mistakes or huge assumptions I've made. ¬†In essence I would also like people to continue with whatever they would like to do, do not take any of this to heart as truth or fact, I'm just going to continue and hold, maybe smile to myself in a few days it the above plays out, or forget it instantly come closing bell Friday.


Keep well my fellow ape brothers and sisters.

Citadel appear to be powerless to orchestrated plays,"Per the Daily Discussion Chat thread this morning:

&gt;I predict a small rise today, 10% drop tomorrow causing SSR, causing a tasty rise Friday.

I predicted this because this is the ideal scenario for a bullish whale, and I believe the bullish whales/HFs are totally in control. The price has been so stable for the past few days (relatively speaking for GME) because they're just setting up the perfect tee-off.

Lo and behold, GME received a 5.6% increase today, including a rise just before close, as opposed to the dips we've seen before close over the last four days. This rise confirms for me that the paladin whales/HFs are indeed planning to pop the old fella on the short sale restriction list during tomorrow's hours to set up a juicy rise Friday.

~$100M worth of crazy deep ITM calls bought this week,"So I saw a wsb post about abnormal option activity on GME, and have been watching this for the last few days. On Fidelity you can see the largest options purchases for the day, and there are a bunch of cheap $5 puts and such for $2-3 dollars, but what has really stood out is call purchasing. On Monday about 3.5K Call contracts with a strike from $5-15 for April 16th were bought on a premium of $110+ per share, Tuesday an additional 1.8K in a similar strike for the same date. Today, another 4.2k calls in that strike with April 16 expiration. Rough estimate of nearly $100M in call options over the last 3 days totaling 1M shares, all from the same exchange as well, PHLX. 

I will be honest, I have no idea what this could mean, and am hoping some apes smarter than me might be able to put it together, but I found this interesting and worth sharing. I screen capped the activity for 3/3/21. I should have screen capped the others as well.

Share lending eToro,"Like the title says: How do you turn it off on eToro? I tried a support ticket and just got this from them:

‚ÄúWhile eToro does not currently engage in securities lending, we may decide that this is the appropriate action to take in the future.

Please note that, should we decide to go in this direction, it will not be possible to opt out of this process.

Securities lending refers to the temporary transfer or loaning of securities including shares of stock, commodities, or derivative contracts from one party to another in return for cash collateral. It is widely used by investment brokers, fund managers and other investors. It provides liquidity to markets and can generate additional income for the holder of the securities.

We hope that this explanation has reassured you. If you have further questions, do let us know.‚Äù

Is it just them hiding the truth and lying or do they actually not have share lending enabled?

Reinforcements incoming: BTC collateral,"I should start by 100% saying this is in no way financial advice. 

I've just noticed that coinbase is offering loans based on your Bitcoin holdings. I had been meaning to invest more into gme, but was hesitant to remove any of my other investments, due to creating a taxable event. I noticed today, that Coinbase is offering loans against your Bitcoin holdings, which will allow me to withdraw money and pay it back without removing my bitcoin, thus avoiding a taxable event. I understand many people's views on cryptocurrency, but being invested for a while, this past year has helped me realize some relatively large gains. This means that in my personal situation, taking a loan out against it, is not a large measurable risk, and would allow me to, in the short term, invest in other things I believe in with an 8% fee, instead of a 20 to 30% tax. So hold strong apes, because in 3 to 5 days, I will have some reinforcements here. 

Once again, I completely understand people's views on coinbase, cryptocurrency, and Bitcoin specifically vary wildly, but I see having a market where you can borrow from your investment as an option, to be a very positive thing in this situation.

TO ALL WHO HAVE STUDENT LOANS AND MORTGAGES: Paying them off is not always the right call.,"Before I go into this, this all depends on your personal financial situation. I am a recently Graduated accountant, so I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to this stuff.

I know a lot of us are really excited to pay off our mortgages and student loans, but make sure to do the math on your interest rates before paying them off right away. I'm going to use my own numbers for this example, but this applies to any loans that you would have. I know a lot of people hate having loans and their immediate reaction to having extra money is to pay off any debts that you have. In some cases, such as credit card debt, this is definitely the right case. When it comes to longer term debts, such as student loans and mortgages, this isn't always the case. It's time to start thinking like the rich, and this is how they save their money better than we do.

The debt: I have 43 000 $ CAD in student. loans at a variable interest rate of prime + 1%. Prime right now is 2.45%, so I have an annual interest rate of 3.45%. Now of course this will go up and down depending on the prime, but we're going to go with that. Paying it off over 15 years (314$ a month, the bare minimum), it will cost me 11 234 $ in interest. That's a lot of money, and our first impulse is to think we want to pay off the debt to save all that interest. 

Total cost of debt including Premium: 43 000 + 11 234  = **54 234 $**

BUT!

What if you decide you aren't going to pay off the debt right away, continue to pay the interest, and invest the money in the market instead.  Let's say you get a 5 % return on the stock market annually. This is a low estimate of course, but I don't want to start throwing big numbers around. 

Compounded annually, over 15 years, at 5%, your 43 000 $ will turn into **89 394 $.** 

This will leave you with a net profit over 15 years of **34 160 $**. This isn't even taking into considered future contributions to your investments over the years. Which I plan on doing anyway because I'm only paying the minimum on my student loans. The same concept applies to your mortgage. 

If anyone is interested in similar examples applied to a mortgage, as well as the potential benefit of only paying the minimum on your student loan and investing the rest, please comment on PM me and I can give out other money management examples that might apply better to your situation. 

I know a lot of the people on this thread are new to investment and might be using this as a shot at paying off your debts and I really want to help you all maximize the potential gains that you can make from the squeeze.

Remember that the best thing you can do is to become an informed trader.,"Start watching technical analysis on YouTube and learning about it online. Learn about candlesticks, including bullish and bearish formations. Go to a real broker or trading website and start analyzing charts over customized time-frames instead of watching the shitty ass graph that Robinhood gives you (I know most of you mfs are still using it, don't lie). 

I recommend ""Think or Swim."" You can also use other platforms like Trading View. They allow you to draw your own trendlines, save them, and customize your time frames. It will help you stay calm and make informed, objective decisions in your trading. Informed retail traders are the biggest threat to hedge funds at this time.

The play for shorts is to continuously try to knock down the price down 7-8% per day to avoid triggering that 10% breaker. 7-8% drop is not enough to cause paper hands, so they will let the price run up to $125 - $130 and then short it down to $110 - $115 hoping to scare some paper hands, just slowly chipping away at the shares they need. 


The play for (institutional) longs is to keep the price even for today and tomorrow. They will want to keep the price around this point to make it easier to cause a 10% drop to trigger the SSR restriction list. I expect that 10% drop to happen Thursday early in the day and then massive buys in the last hour of trading to push the price above $150.",GME,trickfield,26.0,1,2021-03-02,todays volume land million tomorrow million major price movement happen today expect price stay major battles happen friday thursday playing key role set fridays mondays fair movement settlements fridays play shorts continuously try knock price day avoid triggering breaker drop cause paper hands let price run short hoping scare paper hands slowly chipping away shares need play institutional longs price today tomorrow want price point make easier cause drop trigger ssr restriction list expect drop happen thursday early day massive buys hour trading push price,203.0

Here we go! $130!,"Gamestop jumped to $130! The Shorts are losing the battle!

On Friday, GME closed at $101 forcing options contracts to both expire and hit that strike price. This forces options to buy or sell - but they have three days to settle. Today is the last day to settle. Hedges are deciding if they can still risk it for the biscuit. If they don't do something or get a good price, they have to buy at market value. Sort of like a new york landlord forcing you to pay rent at gun point.

**The post**

Credit to  u/SneakingForAFriend for his comments:

&gt;80% of this post goes over what happened this past week, makes guesses on what institutions did, and then **immediately jumps to a date without concrete justification.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Sure, there was a bear trap on Tuesday, there was also one this past Friday and GME is on the SSR list on Monday. It doesn't take into account T+2 dates, and gives people the impression a price inflation is happening on March 19th.

and the following remarks as answers to questions in the section

 

*But how did GME get on the SSR in the first place? This is where it‚Äôs beginning to sound like a conspiracy theory or a fucking masterplan made up by other hedge funds in order to bait out Citadel/Melvin.*

* No. You are making it seem like a conspiracy theory by stating that. Bear traps are common tactics among institutional investors. The tone of this piece is problematic. You are working from emotion.

*Why the hell are investors in Facebook, Coca Cola, Starbucks, and JnJ all hedging against the exact same date? What would JNJ and Starbucks have to do with GameStop?*

* Dude this literally happens all the time with institutional investors. This is amateurish conspiracy implication at best.
* And why would they pick consumer/retail to hedge against a crash? Why wouldn't the pick something like inverse ETFs or commodities, the latter of which are currently low and historically right before a crash? They jump up during crashes. Man.

&gt;I also had few question marks in my head when I read it but I'll certainly read it again.  
&gt;  
&gt;One of the most prominent ones was the FTD issue - to my understanding failing to deliver has little to no repercussions associated with it. So why would they care wo much about paying a fine when the alternative ist going bust? The OPs assumption about the date ist based solely on the premise that the shorts must cover to avoid FTD at any cost. But do they? I doubt it, as long as there aren't serious consequences otherwise.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not trying to spread FUD here (I myself have been holding and buying since mid January) but my largest fear ist that this might become so big that big players like citadel might need a bail out. And if this happens, I bet you that retail will be the ones being fucked over by politicians and Co. On the other hand: I've been really happy to see the obvious fights around certain price points because this means that big fish are in the game on our side, too and they also have the necessary influence to make this happen.  
&gt;  
&gt;So to me, it is no longer a matter of technicals and a particular date but rather a matter of influence, who's the bigger fish in the game and who can benefit more from either of the outcomes. In my opinion this is the direction we should be looking at - what are the connections between the companies, trying to figure out who's on our side and in which direction the regulatory organs are moving.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far the SEC has kept a low profile and I do think that's a good sign since they seem to think they can't change the course of action or are afraid to move in between the big boys fighting it out.

**My take:**

We do not know shit about which day a potential gamma squeeze or short squeeze will take place. What do we know? As of February 26 -2021

 

1. The borrowrate is approx. 9.5%
2. Borrow availability is &lt;635000
3. Short interest is approx. 17 MM and approx. 32% float
4. Taken from JP. "" 

&gt;Short interest is increasing for the first time since the beginning of GME's wild ride - up from 15.5m yesterday to 17.5 today. If the price remains high, option sellers will be forced to buy to remain gamma neutral.""

&amp;#x200B;

Most things would suggest that a suggest that a squeeze is inevitable at this point. **however,** stop the bait. The first dead takeaway should've been the fact that he teased most of you with ""having it fact checked by 7 other people"" and ""Should I post it?"". 

**Most importantly; no date is known. We only know** ***some*** **(important) data.**

Come on people. Just stay safe, do your own research.

"My Critique of u/HeyItsPixeL ""Endgame DD""","EDIT: Since a few people have called me a shill or think this post was created to get people to sell, I need to address this. I AM NOT A SHILL. Look at my other posts, I've been in GME gang since 12/4/20. None of what I said even comes close to suggesting that you should sell. The point of the post was to ensure a flow of legitimate and accurate information.

EDIT 2: Many people have asked and I have realized that there are holes in my short volume ideas. I gotta read up on this more and will likely make a post about it if time permits.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: u/HeyItsPixeL had a lot of good information in his post but there were a few flaws that were likely the result of confirmation bias. They include false assumptions about the high short volume, naked shorting, AI prediction, and high put volume on his chosen day. From my eyes, the other stuff holds and I am personally bullish on the stock  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

His dd can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ltua0n/endgame_dd_how_last_weeks_actions_all_come/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of you smooth-brained apes, I was in great anticipation of u/HeyItsPixeL ""game-changing"" DD. While it was a great post with tons of solid research, I noticed a few fallacies buried in the post that I think should be corrected. While the post is still strong overall, it is important to make sure all information is correct so people aren't mislead.

&amp;#x200B;

*First - the high short volume on 2/25/21*

I thought I'd begin with this since I made a post on this myself and was corrected by a few wrinkle-brains. As [finra](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily) states, the short volume on Thursday was at least 31 MILLION shares and at least 20 MILLION shares on friday. While this is quite the staggering number, it is not to be misinterpreted.

This is the short volume, and not short interest. Short volume is the number of times that short positions are opened. Although nearly impossible, a single share could have been shorted and bought back 31 million times to reach that number. **It is highly likely that most, if not all, of these short positions have already been covered.** According to [fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme), short volume only accounted for 24% of yesterday's total volume which means that every single position could have easily been covered.

With this being said, [FINRA currently lists](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&amp;sdkVersion=2.58.0) the SI % of float to be 60.35% which is almost certainly an underrepresentation because of the ETF shorting. Despite that, this number is still super super high. It has also increased by 50% or 20 percentage points since the last update.

&amp;#x200B;

*Second - naked shorting*

In his post, he says that ""Those were naked shorts being done with counterfeit shares"" In my opinion, this is very dangerous to say since we do not have the evidence to support such a damning claim. As mentioned in the paragraph above, the high volume alone doesn't necessarily mean that shares were naked shorted.

Institutions loan out their shares to be shorted because it is literally free income for them. They can usually get solid returns on them and it doesn't cost them anything. Take Vanguard and Blackrock for instance, who own nearly 15M shares combined. If those two institutions alone lent out their shares, the shares were bought back, and lent them out a second time... there's your 30M short volume.

Finally, naked shorting in itself is not necessarily illegal. As many websites point out, it is a normal part of the market and helps in creating liquidity. It only becomes a problem when a large amount of shares are never 'found', which becomes a Failure to Deliver or FTD.

&amp;#x200B;

*Third - Referencing of the AI Prediction*

I've seen many people referencing this person's AI prediction of GME and I personally find it to be quite foolish. In statistics, we talk about standard deviation which is how far we expect the average data point to be from the mean. This ties into implied volatility, to show how unpredictable a stock's price is going to be. As you know, Gamestop has had unprecedented volatility which makes the price very unpredictable. If you look at the prediction range, it predicts the price to be between $0-130k... Okay cool, that's absolutely pointless. Literally anyone could confidently tell you that the price will fall between a range of that size and be right.

Don't even consider referencing the AI data. It's just people seeing the word AI, thinking its some almighty wisdom, and then using the large range as confirmation bias. Someone who was bearish on GME could look at the chart and say hey, the AI predicts the share price to be $0.

&amp;#x200B;

*Fourth  - Put Volume*

Late in the post, he talks about the crazy high put volume for stocks in many industries. Here, he uses that fact to support his idea of a market implosion on that date. However, 3/19/21 is the third friday of the month, which means that is the day that monthly options fall on. Typically, institutions buy monthly options and sell weekly options. This alone explains for the high put volume, especially when many indicators are pointing to a market crash so they are hedging.

&amp;#x200B;

Final thoughts

I think there are a lot of good ideas there and he dug up some good stuff, but some details are too weak in my opinion. I'm still super bullish on GME and am long, but I felt the need to correct some fallacies that I noticed. This is my first comprehensive DD post, and I look forward to writing one up with my own findings in the next couple of days.

"There will be a squeeze, only now other HF‚Äôs and institutions are in on it diluting our potential price per shareü§¨","We all agree because of the blatant illegal halt of GME trading by Robin Hood etc. in late January, it only delayed the squeeze. The thing that I‚Äôm pissed off about is that allowed every institution and other hedge fund in on it, how convenient! When this thing goes nuclear everyone is going to have to get paid out by liquidating the HF‚Äôs that we‚Äôre short, insurance for option makers, clearing houses, brokers etc...(sorry still smooth brained but I‚Äôm working hard for my first wrinkle)?  The problem I see with that is the supposed number of fake shares that everyone owns or is owed is something like 350 million.  Also, all of the shares that people who exercise their ITM calls that the option makers are going to have to locate.  My lack of experience doesn‚Äôt know if there is some sort of priority the way the shares are paid out, but my feeling is that retail is somehow going to get fucked. Fucked  because of the dilution of shares compared to January.  We had one chance for the largest transfer of wealth without every other HF in on this and the clearinghouses, citadel, Melvin, and or brokers prevented that.  Also maybe someone could explain the uncle Bruce theory better because I suspected there was a way of a hedge fund like citadel to at least hedge against their short position by buying a bunch of cheap calls that will be in the money if the price explodes.  This is how sports gamblers hedge their original bet when they find out something like their favored team‚Äôs starting quarterback is injured or some thing. They just lay a bunch of money on the other team lose a little bit on the juice (interest in this case) from the broker. There isn‚Äôt enough money to pay out all of these option calls and supposed shares out there. I don‚Äôt see how the government doesn‚Äôt step in and settle.  I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs for a pretty penny, but how much could actually be?  10 trillion divided by 500 million is $20K per share.  1 trillion is $2K per share, 100 billion is $200 per share.  How much actual insurance and assets will these companies have to pay out the winners in all this?  I‚Äôm hoping for some smarter people than me to give some probabilities.
TLDR: could Citadel could cover their shorts by going long with inexpensive option calls that go ITM? Possibility of fake shares plus the ones that are owed through option call contracts.  500 million shares vs only 72 million outstanding.

"I am not a shill or bot. I have a legitimate discussion and DD request that needs to be analyzed regarding my concern for the incoming Short Squeeze. If you have a wrinkle in your brain, hop into the discussion. It involves mid to late March earnings reports, and the executive team.","Apes, crayon eaters, and glue drinkers, I wanted to discuss the future of the short squeeze.  I am **bullish** af, and want nothing more than the redistribution of wealth to the people after what happened in 2008.  We have not forgotten what happened, and will run these hedgies into the ground, and make Wall Street bleed red. $100k is not a meme, and this is financial advice because **fuck the SEC**.   When you look at the law, it states,  ""**Market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically)""** [This is pulled straight from their website](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/market-manipulation#:~:text=Market%20manipulation%20is%20when%20someone,rise%20or%20to%20fall%20dramatically)**.**  We aren't artificially increasing demand, we just like the stock. So fuck 'em, they're useless anyways because the suits on the other side are clearly engaging in it.

Now, on to the meat of my post. Sorry about the rant up there, I'm just tired of the bullshit.  My question to you wrinkly brained folks is what happens around mid to late March regarding insider holdings of the stock? Let me elaborate a bit more.  So, the general consensus is that right now Gamestop management and the board are under some very tight lipped rules because they have insider information regarding Q4 earnings, as well as how they plan to pivot the company to its future.  They can't comment or say anything regarding what is happening around GME's stock price as the SEC might actually pull their head out of their ass and come after anyone in management that says something that could be a catalyst prior to their official earnings release.

So my questions for discussion are as follows:

* With the newly ousted CFO, could there be a chance that as he exits the company, he liquidates the stock he owns on the market, and allowing short hedgies a small pressure relief valve to cover their position?  Theoretically, that could be good for us, but at the same time we don't want ANY sells to maximize the suffering of the shorters. 
   * I read an [article here](https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-cfo-jim-bell-about-30-million-exit-package-bloomberg-2021-2), that wasn't very clear on if management is buying him out, or if he exits with the stock.  Elaboration would be appreciated. 
* According to SEC form S3, page 6, [linked here,](https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-312781/#rom50019_9) GME currently has 69,746,960 shares outstanding with the rights to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Obviously they would never offer that many shares due to diluting ownership, but hear me out.  We know that the company has insider shares.  [I calculated that insiders shares are 20,474,763, based off the numbers that I got from this website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity).  [This link shows my calculation in a screenshot.](https://imgur.com/4bDigry)  So based off of this, the available for trading float after accounting for CURRENTLY restricted shares owned by insiders is 49,272,197.  So about 30% of the float is restricted, and this does not include what institutions own...that is not relevant to this post.
* The big question I have for you wrinkly brains is what would stop management from issuing additional stock after their earnings release because they are no longer prohibited from talking and discussing what's going on, **and** what would prevent insiders from selling some of their shares in the company?
   * I know that insiders must retain a certain amount of stock as its required by most companies  to keep xx% of stock if you are CFO or CEO, etc.  So they couldn't just offload a ton and just decide to liquidate everything, but some smaller holders like the directors possibly could once they're no longer restricted. Greed is human nature, and why wouldn't they want a quick buck during this unprecedented time?
   * Additionally, if management were to issue shares, during this craziness would be the best time in my opinion. You could raise a significant amount of capital by issuing 500,000 shares when the price is $350 a share and minimize dilution versus when price is $10 a share and needing to issue 10 million shares to raise capital.  

I know this may seem FUD like, but these are genuine questions that must be addressed to reassure some of the paper handed brethren who tremble under such immense pressure. I am not one of these paper hands. It was a long post, I know. But I haven't seen ANY mentions of how this could impact the ultimate goal of a short squeeze if additional shares were to unexpectedly enter the market whether it be from issuance, or insiders.

"Divining from the Hedgefund Propaganda - An ""Analysis""","The thing about apes - they have incredible working memory. Way more than humans. In [this computer game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsXP8qeFF6A) apes can win 90% of the time while humans typically lose 29/30 times (watch the video to understand some metaphors later). I haven't found any good explanation of why apes have this incredible working memory ability... But the fact of the matter is: ape can see.

I don't personally know any hedgefund managers or contributors, so I can only go on second-hand info here, but it seems painfully obvious the short hedgefunds are built out of two categories: boomers and hubris. Unfortunately for them, that's a really bad combo.

Myself like the most of us here are millenials or zoomers, so we get the internet. Personally I grew up as a teen on the internet in the wild west, where people can say literally anything at any moment. You grow thick skin, you get know what people are \*truly like\* as if they're behind closed doors. That fosters a certain level of wisdom and intuition about human nature. We understand people and media on a visceral level our near and dear parents/grandparents could only occasionally dream of.

Then the hedge fund boomers come along and play their 1960's propaganda playbook to the T, and ape see straight through the white dots, divining the true numbers behind them, all in an instant. *For us apes the hedgie propaganda acts as the most reliable indicator of truth during the entire short squeeze event*. They don't understand the internet or the Streisand effect. The key takeaway: **if the hedgies had simply ignored Reddit, I wouldn't have bought any GME, and there are many thousands of people in the same ape-brained situation as me**.

Here's a short list of some of the propaganda tactics employed by the hedgefund dimwits.

1. Used the mainstream media to spread a homogenous and coordinated message against Reddit users multiple times.
2. Created or acquired many fake Reddit accounts to push a specific narrative in a predictable manner.
3. Attempted to divert Reddit users and mainstream news followers to waste money on distraction stocks, like SLV.
4. Created fake DD on Reddit with elaborate details that magically predicted price action, but also made basic conflations (designed to spread dismay by appearing true, but being false).
5. WSB subreddit completely taken over, mass media reported the opposite.
6. The narrative of the shills/bots has changed in a transparent and predictable manner multiple times. Roughly speaking the narrative timeline is something like: Pumps about SLV/weed; The squeeze already happened/the shorts covered; Negotiation for low squeeze price expectations; Making fun of users with low share counts. The first couple narratives were attempts to prevent the squeeze. The next couple narratives were attempts to mitigate the squeeze.
7. Cut buying of GME late January and proceeded with the whole congress political theatre. Smelvin trying to smear Reddit.

This kind of blatant propaganda tells an obvious truth, and us apes build our own rough list of conclusions. The bullet numbers match up with the previous list.

1. The financial media is always wrong. The mainstream news media is corrupt. The homogenous nature of their message makes it obviously dishonest.
2. There must be a really strong reason to push a narrative so hard with fake accounts, they must have realized they're in deep shit.
3. Diversions from GME simply fuel more diamonds for GME. Streisand effect.
4. Fake DD is a real act of desperation. Their desperation is our confirmation.
5. Taking over WSB must have cost a lot effort and time. Nobody does that unless shit is absolutely serious.
6. Each time the narrative is adjusted grants us apes really valuable information. It invalidates the previous narrative and also invalidates the narrative they've switched to. By simply remembering the chain of narratives, us apes build a small list of truths. A narrative shift leaks a lot of valuable ape information.
7. Can't let the poors do a capitalism! Buying was cut based on corruption. It's as simple as that. Cutting buying guaranteed the squeeze to happen even worse the next time around. Fucking indignant goons they are - Yoda, probably.

In summary: they say ""don't think about a big pink elephant"" and we all start thinking about GME ü§£

Sure, all the interesting DD posted by other users is nice. Some of it is convincing. But, at the end of the day myself and many of us here simply bought into GME in reaction to the Eye of Sauron staring straight at the fucking stock. Like, what the hell. The sheer incompetence of this whole propaganda scheme just boggles my mind. If you laser focus all your effort onto GME like that... WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN? I just can't stand the hubris. The gall. These idiots deserve to lose everything for basic lack of wisdom.

"To clarify, here's what YOU are holding for","I want this to be a serious post so keep the ape chatter to a minimum. 

1. $ (whether you have some now and want more or don't have any)
2. A goal or objective that can only be completed with $
3. You hate the system and want to be part of THE LARGEST TRANSFER OF WEALTH EVER
4. You believe in the future of GameStop and/or gaming is an important thing in your life
5. All of the above

I'm in it here for 1 and 3 primarily. I live a comfortable upper middle class life - great job, benefits, good health, wonderful family + friends, home and a well funded savings/investment account. 

When I look around my circle of family and friends, they are not all so fortunate. When asked what I was going to do with my stimulus check last year by a close friend, I replied ""I'm not eligible"". To which he replied, ""must be nice.""

Is it nice?

When I was younger I would reply to these kinds of comments with ""I didn't realize there was a penalty for success"" but if there's anything I learned in the past 5 years is that my success is directly tied to others. I did not do this alone. The men and women who served as my ride sharing driver, delivered my food, fixed my car, cut my hair, cleaned my hotel rooms, manicured my lawn, fixed my toilet...you get the idea. All of these individuals allowed me to live a life with minimal stress and that directly impacted my physical and mental health. 

I work in fucking marketing. I make on average 4x the salary of everyone of those professions. What I do is not critical for anyone or group to function. I'm tired of being part of a system that gives fuck all about those who actually matter. 

I often criticize America for not having a culture and that it's ""borrowed"". What this community has done though is shed light on a culture of caring and love I thought didn't exist. If that's not culture I don't know what is.

This is our Finial Boss, like in a Video Game. It feels like this has been going on forever. You have been repeatedly kicked to shit, your hand is cramping and you really need to piss. So glad that your persistent is finally paying off, you have them on the ropes.

But they just changed into their third phase, and you have no idea what‚Äôs going on. All you know is they Deadpooled some Lasers out of there magic satchel all of the sudden and you wonder why your leg is suddenly warm and wet. 

That is where we are, we have backed the hedges into a corner and well you know the saying about cornering Animals. They are so desperate they are willing to throw away millions of dollars in an effort get us to sell. They are scared they know they are about to get the finical equivalent of a fisting without lube and they don‚Äôt want it, they really do not want it. 

Because while it many not be this week there are a stupid amount of calls that expire on the 19th of March. So as long as we hold and drive the price up to $800 before then we are golden.

So change out of those piss soaked jeans and keep  holding!! Keep focused, grit your teeth and forget about these small $100 a share profits. Even if you sell and rebuy you are at worse slowing the markets momentum and at worse killing the squeeze. We are aiming for 100k a share and as long as we hold the line we will make it there, it is only a matter of time.

FINALLY OFF THE 7 DAY BAN. I LIVE IN A TOWN CALLED VALHALLA AND SO DOES MY GIRL AND OFF TO VALHALLA WE RIDEEEEEE

Some shit I wanted to get off my chest for a week straight that I'm finna dump on yall right quick

Please post on your social medias about this. I posted my 20k loss porn to my insta story and then showed my turnaround and people think I'm a fucking prophet now. I called it on Monday on my story that round 2 was gonna begin and a buncha my frat bros and hometown friends believed in me and threw in when it was like $44. Keep encouraging people to move off RobbinDaHood

Also, let's all show them.what the fuck diamond hands are made of. They shorted the float like 3x over realistically right? That means they have to buy our shit 3x over just to make everything right. DFV showed us the playbook mannn. Take some of your gainz and double down on dat bitch when it slightly dips and the rocket stops to refuel and hold that share to Valhalla. 

We shouldn't even be considering selling off to meet out principal before 1k after what we fucking went through. So this is my plan. Try to recoup your initial investments in the early thousands so you can play with house money. This shits not gonna end til next month the squeeze is gonna take a whileeee.  There's a lotta options and shit like ETF shares recalling that suggest 3/19 is some kind of detonation date from what I understand so we should really try to keep riding this out and rolling over into more stonks from our deep reserves of tendies to keep fueling. 

Def gotta make.pit stops along the way to cash out. 1k 5k 10k 25k etc. New DD suggesting 100k and 500k. I love to see it. Whatever we believe in we can meme it into existence if he just HODL FOR MAXIMUM PAINNNN. We have the power when it gets down to the last 20% or so of covering shorts to decide to sell 1 share at a time and drive the price up to the moon. That's where the apes can finally have their fill. 

Also, once we're done pillaging the DTCC I think the move is to save 50% of our earnings in some kinda CD or some shit because we will get taxed out the asssss. Take whatever amount you feel comfortable saving as emergency funds and the rest I think we gotta YOLO into crypto for the rest of this year and pump everyone's fucking crypto bagssss. 

That shits in some kind of mega bull run that happens every 4 years due to some kinda Bitcoin Halving or whatever gay shit those nerds are on. If the GMEtards come riding in from Valhalla and pump everyone's bags and Cash out during the summer we'll have mega bags that we can then reinvest into the crashed stock market that will take months to sort itself out. 

After that we can truly create an ape market where we can impact the market with our decisions finally and hunt other shorties and squeeze them out of existence If we so choose. Or maybe try copping the blue chippers and controlling mass amounts of those. 

Ultimately the biggest move is real estate. How dope would it be if the GMEtards got together and bought actual real estate in plazas and shit where our daddy RC will wanna build e-sports meet and greet suites and gaming cafes and lounges and shit. WE CAN BE THE ONES THAT OWN THOSE BUILDINGS. WE CAN BUILD THE GME WE WANT AND WORK TOGETHER AND DOMINATE THE REAL ESTATE/ARENA ASPECT OF THE SOON TO BOOM GAMING INDUSTRY. 

I FUCKING LOVE ALL.OF YOU APES I DEARLY MISSED INTERACTING WITH YOU ALL THIS PAST WEEK. LETS FUCKING RIDE TO VALHALLA!!!!!!

Let's show them the ape market is real. As a conspiracy theorist lemme tell you about the Age of Aquarius. You know how the Earth rotates around the sun and shit and rotates on its axis? It also wobbles like a top at a rate of 1 degree every 72 years. So every 30 degrees/2160 years it changes to a new zodiac sign. 

Like 2000 years ago it was Pisces and thus a lot of imagery like the Jesus fish which was the OG Christian imagery before the cross somehow supplanted it. 

Either way on a grand scale like thousands of years nothing predicts the rise and fall of empites like the stars do. So this is just the time of a different age and apparently the vibe of Aquarius is revelation or pulling back the curtain to expose the inner workings of certain tingz. Thus apokalypse in Greek meaning a revealing and not Armageddon like Christians will have you believe. 

So yea I just think the consciousness of the masses is slowly increasing to where we understand we hold the power moreso than the 1%. And it's ironic/simulation vibes that a company called GameSTOP pulls back the curtain on how corrupt the market is to the common man. 

Or rather it will be shown that the emperor has had no clothes after all. And that apes can ride bulls and wrestle with bears.

Why a low value might be good today,"Smooth Brain Ape with an idea here. I may have a theory, about what is going on with the value today. For this I put myself in to the shoes of a big money player (BMP). This is also based on the assumption that GME was SSR yesterday, but not today.

Yesterday we saw a small gamma squeeze and a lot of people got hyped up. Many of those people hoped / expected the value to increase even further beyond.

If I was the BMP and if the call options of yesterday were in my favor I would ""abuse"" the fact that GME was SSR. It worked. The gamma squeeze activated and I collected a nice amount of shares. 

Now look at today. During the day the value jumped here and there, but right now it's kinda low. AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT IT TO BE AS THE BMP. I want GME to be SSR TOMORROW so I can blast the value all the way up to 800$ to collect the next call-checkpoint. Thanks to the gamma I even have a nice amount of shares to short GME myself. So the drop of the value might be caused by the same player who caused the gamma yesterday simply to prepare the next spike tomorrow.

EDIT:
It might not be TOMORROW, but maybe at the next time GME is SSR. I don't want to rise hope too early.

It's just an idea that's floating in my head. I'm completely smooth brained by now and this theory might be complete shit. This is not advice in any way.

Today's Chart,"So, after a sudden drop this morning which impacted a large chunk of tickers (even AAPL!), from just before noon through the rest of the day we had a very nice uptrend in a tight, regular pattern (between the two green lines). The 10-day moving average (MA) (yellow line) crossed above the 50 MA (light red line) just after 1 pm and then the 50 day MA crossed above the 200-day MA (purple line) at about 3:30. All of this is very bullish.

I think that some of the drop this morning was due to profit taking after the nice run-up we saw on Monday. But, like we saw, a big chunk of the market saw the same exact movement, so I, personally, don't think it is of great concern to GME itself.

We shall see what after market &amp; tomorrow brings. Hopefully, it will break through that green resistance line and keep on going!

"In theory, how would we know when a squeeze has hit its peak?","I'M NOT TRYING TO COORDINATE ANY KIND OF SELL POINT HERE. JUST ASKING A GENERAL HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

With that out of the way, I'm just a retarded ape who licks paint, so I was hoping someone with more knowledge could answer this for me.

There's been a lot of discussions about a possible price GME could squeeze to, but I'm sure I'm not alone here in not really knowing how a squeeze plays out. For starters, would we see a massive jump from $40 to $10k in a matter of hours, or would it be spread out over multiple days/weeks?

With the fast drop-off that we saw from January's squeeze, I'm worried that the big squeeze won't hit its potential because people are going to see the price start rising and immediately sell once it starts to get high so that they don't lose a bunch of money again. However, I'm sure others don't want to be on the other side of this, where they think the price is going to keep climbing and hold while the price plummets back down.

"Once we hit the moon, what then?","This has become a real community. And more than a community, it's become a movement. And this movement is about to be massively tenderized on its way too the moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, it can and should be about paying off student loans, or debt from medical bills, vet bills, or getting that tiny bit of financial security for working as hard as your parents did while getting half the benefits. And yes, if we all get a mini-lambo or whatever along the way, great too. 

But why give up what we have here as a community, as a movement, once that happens?  

When the squazzle squozes, and GME goes to the moon, and all the hedgies will quake and the entire market gasp, all eyes will swerve here. It will be like when the eye of Sauron swerved to mount doom when Gollum took the ring from Frodo, and he sent his Nazgul in to try to fix things, but it was too late! (a few LTR metaphors never hurt). When the ring vanishes, and Sauron's towers crumbled, the result was a sonic boom that will be heard throughout the markets, all the halls of power, and resound throughout the world. 

This movement can change the entire Market. And even a lot beyond that. 

But we don't need to disperse after GME. We shouldn't. This is too new, too interesting, and this community is about to shake up what seemed unshakable. 

Of course they will try to make sure to never let their pants down like this again. They will have to change a lot going forward. But this will be a shot heard round the world. 

What should a massively tenderized world reorienting movement do once it gets tenderized? Should we look for new types of squeezes, new ways to make the HFs feel the wrath of a zillion apes crowdsourcing ideas? Beyond giving to charity (always good of course), what else could this new movement do? 

I can't help but think that GME on the moon is only the beginning. 

Here's my thoughts on this (I posted it at night a while back, so it kinda vanished, but seems a lot more relevant now). Curious what people think: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ln756f/thoughts\_on\_future\_of\_gme\_community/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ln756f/thoughts_on_future_of_gme_community/)

Can we become a new sort of player to be reckoned with once we get to the moon? We know that as individuals, the big-dogs and fat-cats will always win, but through some crowdsourcing and dispersed dreams of the moon, we are about to turn the tables on a rigged system. 

What do YOU think we could do as a community, as a movement, once we hit the moon?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\---

DISCLAIMERS: 

This community does not, and will not, manipulate anything. 

This is because this community only does one simple thing: we crowdsource info and ideas. We share publicly available information, and try to make sense of it, making the most of our collective intelligence (wrinkled and smooth brained all, and a lot of due diligence!). 

That's completely legal, completely legit, and it works. Those with knowledge and experience dissect the details so that disinformation and bad theories get torn apart, letting the legit stuff come to the surface. And then a zillion individual dreams of the moon do the rest. 

It's such a simple idea, yet completely unprecedented, cause no-one thought of doing it this way before. And look at all the power to the players it's about to unleash  ...

\-

What's my stake in all this? I'm currently down 30k cause I bought in Jan 26, and I make as much as a HS teacher, we had just sold our house, long story, but to me, that's a TON of cash.  

Also, I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, or any advice at all. Don't listen to me! I'm a dumb-ass who loves eating crayon-burgers and paste for fun. Do your own due diligence and make up your own mind!

\----------

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR: We're all about to be tenderized by a moon voyage! This is a great community, and it feels like a movement. Should we just disperse once we reach the moon? What sort of future could you see for this movement after the moon? Could this be just the beginning? Could we become a new sort of collective force to be reckoned with, looking for new types of squeezes and new sorts of plays, to turn the tables on those who rig the system, in the market, or beyond?

 **GameStop Announces Resignation of CFO and Succession Plan to Support Transformation** 

GRAPEVINE, Texas, Feb. 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- **GameStop Corp.

So here's where I see the current situation:,"Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, or to offer up any insight you have.

So last Friday retail had what I think was a major victory... There was a FUD campaign that quickly spread to make people think we'd lost if the price closed under $40. 

It appears that the day before, they'd gotten around 800k shorts prepared just for that; and they dropped 600k all at once to tank the price. Then another 200k shortly after that. But then DFV doubled down and retail started buying up a bunch of shares in the last couple hours. The HFs got fucked with their options being nullified.

Then we had hype going into Monday and there was a lot of buying pressure. It seems like the HFs pushed back hard with the shorts just to keep the price down and could barely contain it. And we can see that the short volume was rather high yesterday.

And now today.. Super low volume. Some brokerages having ""issues."" At the same time? Please. I think HFs are running out of options here and it's becoming harder and harder for them to control the price through shorting. Why? Because there are a bunch of retarded apes who won't stop buying and holding. Liquidity is dry.

So their next trick was to interrupt buying to help keep the price down. It's just a play for time. Maybe they just want more time to hide away as much of their assets as possible. Maybe they're trying to slowly liquidate the rest of their holdings to prevent a panic selloff too soon. Or maybe they're just trying to fuck with the apes as much as they can before the shit hits the fan.

This ape thinks it's all of the above.

I wouldn't be surprised if there's still issues with those brokerages tomorrow. Then we'll get to see what the new report says later that day. Not that it matters much at this point.

I'm not sure when this thing will launch, but it feels like we're close. We may well already be in the countdown phase. It's just a matter of time. Anyone have anything to add or correct me on?

TL;DR: The end is nigh! Keep buying and holding you retarded apes! Not financial.. Whatever.

However, this is not supposed to be such a big deal. It is expected that the management that just sat and oversaw the massive decline in a retailer is going to be replaced by a more e-commerce savvy CFO who will be able to oversee the transformation of the company into the digital space.

How much of GME do we own?,"An attempt for an estimation of the number of GME holders by doctorzaius6969

Hello there,
Disclaimer: This is not a financial advice, I am an crayon eating Ape and the numbers shown below are highly inaccurate and partially based on personal opinion. This is more of a play with numbers and should not be considered as aprofessional financial investment advice.

Since the calculations are inaccurate I highly welcome any suggestions how to improve the calculations or sources of data to try to improve the accuracy of the result. 

TLDR:
I estimate the total number of GME holders in the OECD nations except USA as 4,456,534 People, including the USA the result is 7,582232 People. 
This means, that even if the average number of GME stocks hold by retailers is 1 (Which seems to be totally unrealistic low) retail would hold 6,4% ex. USA and 10.9 % incl. USA of all shares of GME. 
You see, if the average number of stocks hold would be 10, retailers incl. USA would already hold over 100%. 



Recently there was the following news going around, that despite the huge drop, over 50000 Swedish were still Diamond-Handing GME stocks.

https://www.msn.com/sv-se/nyheter/other/tusentals-svenskar-kvar-i-gamestop-efter-hausse/ar-BB1dMot0?MSCC=1604316491

According to the article (and Google Translator) , there is one trading platform with 28000 GME holders and another one with 36000 GME holders.
I guess there are other plattforms in Sweden for buying GME so the combined number of 64000 shold be the minimum number of people in Sweden holding GME. The real number is likely to be higher. 

Since the data of the minimum GME holders seemed to be trustable, I wanted to try to estimate the number of people holding GME worldwide.
For that I did following calculation:

Most of the data I used are 2018 data  from the OECD. 

Sweden has a population of 10,120,242 people 
If 64000 people are holding GME 0.63% of the Swedish population is holding GME. 
We could just use this percentage and apply it to the world population and guess the number of world GME holders.
However, this result would be highly inaccurate, besides mamy other problems the main issue of this calculation would be, that it does not take the income of the different people of different mations into account. Sweden is with an Nominal Annual Avarage Income of 41,748 USD    a relatively wealthy country where average people can afford to buy GME. As a comparison, the Annual Avarage Income im Mexico is 6,848 USD. Obviously the ratio of people in Mexico who can afford to buy GME should be much lower than in Sweden.
To correct this problem I used a correction factor, which defined Sweden as 1 and calculated the ratio of the income of the Country to the Swedish income.
In Mexicos example I calculated 6848 (Mexicos Income) /41748 (Swedish Income) = 0.164.
I multiplied then the correction factor with the Swedish ratio of GME holders:
0.0063*0.164=0.00103
This means, I estimate that the ratio of people who are holding GME in Mexico is 0.1%.
Since Mexico has a population of 123, 364, 284 it means, that the estimated total amount of GME holders in Mexico is 123,364 people. 

I did this calculation (with more accurate numbers without rounding up or down etc.) by throwing in the data of every OECD nation where I was able to get the data into Excel and came to the following result. 

The total number of GME holders of the OECD Nations except the USA is: 4,456,534 People. 

The reason why I took the USA out of the calculation is, that since all the GME mania happened in the USA, I think the ratio of GME holders in the USA is much higher than this calculation would suggest. However if I include the USA in to thr calculatio, despite the likelihood that the result could be too low for the USA, I get the following result for GME holders in OECD: 7,582232

This means, that even if the average number of GME stocks hold by retailers is 1 (Which seems to be totally unrealistic low) retail would hold 6,4% ex. USA and 10.9 % incl. USA of all shares of GME. 
You see, if the average number of stocks hold would be 10, retailers incl. USA would already hold over 100%.

screen of the table: https://ibb.co/MVsnfsW

I personally think that this is a very conservative calculation so I believe the real numbers are significantly higher

ELI5 - Institutional Share Sale &amp; the Squeeze,"Once the MOASS occurs, how will Institutional Share Holders, or any other Shareholder outside of retail, react to the sudden volatility in the Share Price? 

AFAIK, circa. 260M Share Volume with 73M Shares held by institutional investors and roughly, 30M held by Retail. Surely, these guys will set the price ceiling, rather than retail? What's to say that they won't dump some or all of their 73M Shares on the way up?

In addition, why wouldn't a Firm like Morgan Stanley also dump to help their friends?

We have to do it for them. And we have to Twitterize it, distilling it into short, direct, pointed questions suitable for a Congressional hearing. Questions like:
What sort of practices have been/could have been historically used by hedge funds to 1. disguise naked short selling and 2. avoid timely delivery of shares?
What are ‚Äúfailures to deliver‚Äù (FTD)? Is the rate of FTD especially high in GME? Why?
Does Melvin Capital or Citadel have short positions on ETFs that include GME? Could this be used to mislead the public on these hedge funds‚Äô short positions on GME?
What‚Äôs the difference between a short squeeze and a gamma squeeze? Which of these was responsible for the price movement of GME to $480?
What would‚Äôve happened if buying of GME had not been restricted on Thursday Jan. 28th? Specifically, what would‚Äôve happened if retail buying pressure continued drive the price of GME higher? Would retail investors still end up ‚Äúbagholders‚Äù in this scenario?
How much did short sellers stand to lose in this scenario? If they incurred losses exceeding their assets, who covers the remaining debt, by law? How do the potential legal penalties for various sorts of criminal malfeasance, performed in order to artificially halt a short squeeze, compare to the financial consequences of a short squeeze, for Melvin, Citadel, the DTCC, and other affected parties?
Even these last few are probably still overworded... The point is we need to get our reps asking the right questions. Selling order flow is meh, but flushing out hidden short positions and enforcing timely delivery of shares would be the start of a just outcome. But the SEC probably won‚Äôt do this without EXTREME political pressure from Congress; even then it‚Äôs no sure thing. But putting your representatives on the right track is the best hope you have to expose any shadow fuckery.

The website of Fintel states:

""GME / GameStop Corp. short volume is shown in the following chart. Short Volume is a data set that can be used to understand investor sentiment. When an investor makes a short sale, they do so with the belief that a security will decline in price. If the short sale volume increases as a percentage of the total volume, then that suggests a bearish (negative) sentiment by the market. If short sale volume decreases as a percentage of total volume, then that suggests a bullish (positive) sentiment. ""

Single most important question to be asked in the next hearing," 

Question to be asked to Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel CEOs:

**Are you aware of any naked short positions held directly or indirectly on GME any time in 2021? Please answer yes or no.**

Such a simple question without an escape route, and one that directly pins them as it's an illegal activity. I do remember it getting mentioned during the last hearing, but I don't think anyone put them on the spot.

DFV inspired me to believe in myself.,"This was a process that's been ongoing for me.  I've been learning to trust my own instinct and opinions regardless of what other people think or say.  I've realized that a lot of the time, people are wrong.  I don't think I'm the brightest crayon in the box, but I do believe that I'm smart enough to recognize my limitations and learn from my mistakes.  Ironically, that already puts me well ahead of the pack.  

I can only assume that /u/DeepFuckingValue has not always been right.  This was potentially the play of his lifetime.  It is so far.  Who knows if he'll have another one?  It could happen.  But before this one, I'm sure he made lots of mistakes.  Got things wrong.  Messed up.  That's human.  That's normal.  But I also imagine that he's had little successes along the long way.  Perhaps little compared to this, but big in his eyes and at the time that he had them.  He started learning to trust his intuition.  He got some things right.  This led him to believe.  This led him to go all-in on GME despite what boomers, hedge funds, CNBC, and assholes on Reddit said.  And he won.

This is how the process has been for me, at least.  I've made mistakes, but I've also had some pretty big wins.  Not like DFV's, but big for me, you know?  I don't think anyone is born knowing much of anything.  You have to stumble your way through it all.  It's developed.  The fools are the ones who think they've got it all figured out.

I never really though much of myself, honestly.  It's sad, but true.  But as I started challenging my beliefs and taking little risks, following my heart so to speak, I've realized that I'm capable of so much more than I ever thought possible.  And when I see DFV and what he did, I see myself.  There's no reason that any of us couldn't have been DFV.  That's why we love him.  He's from our generation.  He looks and talks like us.  He uses Reddit.  He's a nice guy.  It could have been, literally, any of us.

I'm not just talking about stocks, guys.  DFV likes investing, and that's where he chose to apply to his talents.  I'm getting into it myself thanks to all of this.  But what I'm learning about myself applies to all of life itself.  I can be good at anything I want to be good at.  I can form my own opinions.  I can keep my dignity and stand my ground in the face of ridicule.  We all can.  DFV was a shining example of this.

And what I like most about all of this is that it shows us that we don't need to be fake.  I think the world, and particularly our generation (the younger folk), are tired of being fake.  We're tired of ""I appreciate your question"", we're tired of people's inability to answer a simple yes or no question, we're tired of manipulation and lies.  What's cool about DFV is that he just gives it to you straight.  He has nothing to hide.  He knows what he's talking about, and he's willing put his money where his mouth is, and explain to you in simple terms why he does what he does.  He believes in what he's doing, and he likes the stock.  

It's a wonderful change of pace from a society where we don't believe in what we're doing, but we fake it anyway in order to make some sort of profit or gain off of it.  I think we're all tired of that.  DFV, and the GME movement in general, represents a radical change from all of that.

That's why I bought my original share @ 230.  I bought some more later on the dips.  For me, even if this thing goes to 0, it's money well spent.  I could afford to lose it.  I just wanted to be part of something bigger than me.  

But hey, who knows?  It's not over yet.  The squeeze could still squoze.  DFV doubled his shares.  I do like the fundamentals of the long-term stock.  I'm holding.

But no matter what happens with GME, I know that these events have changed me forever.  They've helped me to believe in myself.  They've helped me to remember that it's OK to follow your heart and stand up for what you feel is right.  They've helped me to trust my instincts.  DFV could have been me.  He could have been any of us.

Will society change because of this?  Who knows.  That's a very huge battle.  But what I am sure of is that *I've* changed because of it.  That's all I have control of at the end of the day.  But you know what's cool?  The more I believe in myself, the more I help others believe in themselves.  

That's what DFV did for all of us.

No Regrets - For those of us who bought at the top,". . . Alright you diamond hand bitches.  Listen up.  This is important. 

I'm sure many here were part of the original WSB community and already experienced diamond hands up and diamond hands down. . . . But for some of us, all we know is diamond hands down.  I joined WSB the day the story broke around the 1.2 million member point and my dumbass bought in high. I diamond handed all the way down and I've continued to buy.    


I don't know what it feels like to diamond hand up. . . so I'd like to tell you a little story. . . 

&amp;#x200B;

The year is 2070 and you will be on your death bed.  Your family and loved ones are gathered around you in the last moments of your life. Your grandson, little Timmy approaches the bed. He's nervous.  He doesn't know what to say. Finally, he thinks of something and with his cute little lisp, his question begins to take shape. 

""Grandpa,"" He says, through the speech impediment, ""you lived a long and productive life, do you have any regrets?""

You laugh to yourself and the room is quiet. Hardly audible, you mudder something about GME. Timmy starts jumping up and down. 

""You were there? You were part of GME? That's amazing. Did you say you regret selling?""  The hospital room is buzzing. Everyone is talking about how your a legend having participated in the great GME movement. 

You shake your head in response to Timmy's question and hold up left your hand to regain control of the room. It's finally quiet again. Everyone looks to you in anticipation.

Your right hand comes out shaking from under the covers of the bed. You're holding something.  It's paper. Physical certificates!  Shares of GME.  They are worth millions each. Your family is rich!  The room erupts, everyone has questions. They are talking about buying boats and houses and sports cars. 

Finally, you motion again. You have something else to say. There is a bic lighter now in your left hand. 

Timmy calls out, ""you diamond ass mother fucker . . .""

""Timmy!"" Your daughter interrupts him. ""Show some respect.  It's diamond HANDED mother fucker,"" She says with a respectful tone. 

You put the lighter to the paper as you speak your last words. 

""This is the way. . ."" 

""This is the way,"" Your family repeats in response. 

The shares burn on the floor next to the bed and no one attempts to put them out. You have taught them well and you have no regrets.

SEC IS MONITORING REDDIT,"Not sure if this has been posted, but as you can see from below, Reddit is definitely being monitored. This is just a heads up to be wary of the HF shills who are coming on here and other subs trying to organize coordinated buying, selling, or taking any market action whatsoever. Doing this sort of thing is probably just a lame attempt at setting up the sub and trying to get a trading halt on GME to buy themselves some more time. (You know, if instead of time, they would just buy the freaking stock, all of this would be over!) So, don't feed it! When I have responded I have let the poster know that we are not interested in such manipulations.

I say ""probably"" because we have gotten a lot of new members (over 100K!) who are genuine supporter of GME but just don't know about the shills. Therefore, don't assume that someone is a shill if they post something like this. They may be, but they might not be. Be polite but firm and explain why such activities are not tolerated.

Just my opinion. Make your own decisions.

How Philosophy Applies to GME: Occam‚Äôs vs. Hanlon‚Äôs Razor,"Here is my philosophical DD- one we need to value because the markets are both subjective and objective.

Occam‚Äôs razor = simplest solution is often right.

Ex. = 1989 60 villagers were killed by Bengal tigers. Someone realized bengals attack if they feel hidden. Masks were sold to mimic the look of eyes in the back of your head- an idea stolen from insects. No one else died if the masks were worn.

Hanlon‚Äôs razor= don‚Äôt assume the worst from others since that is most unlikely.

Ex. 1962 Vasili Arkhipov was on a Russian sub with an (unknown) nuclear torpedo. US told Russia it was dropping depth charges to cause subs to surface. Russia didn‚Äôt tell their subs. The sub is getting hit by depth charges. 3 senior officers had to agree to launch the nuclear missile- Vasili said no and decided to surface the sub to contact Russia. He saved us from a world war

Lastly, extremes are uncommon, but they do happen. The more we go to the tails of a deviation, the more we see the improbable. The more a model hasn‚Äôt accounted for the improbable, the more the improbable is likely to happen.

Let‚Äôs zoom in on GME. 

Facts:
- this is a first of its kind scenario
- black swans have happened through history and will continue to happen 
- supply and demand dictate stock price
- currently, shorts have to be bought back
- currently, market makers have a finite amount of cash flow 
- models made by humans can have errors
- the age of technology has brought about unpredictable realizations

Hypothesis- Hedge funds overshorted GME and no models accounted for retail buying and holding the % which we have today. A MOASS has never happened. What we‚Äôve seen with float %, ETFs with GME being shorted at the levels they‚Äôve been, the hearing...these one of a kind events cause one of a kind reactions. This is when we use Hanlon‚Äôs razor for an educated opinion- these actions are malicious and planned because they‚Äôre too improbable to be unrelated based on all DD I‚Äôve seen. 

Now to the outcome. We‚Äôve all seen DD on possibilities here.

Worst case scenario: We hold the bag. This doesn‚Äôt decrease international perception of US markets. Short interest doesn‚Äôt bleed the hedge funds dry because we individually ring the bell and sell at a loss. The hike in short interest on ETFs with GME is unrelated. The rise of bots and shills and FUD tactics was unrelated. A second squeeze doesn‚Äôt happen because HFs find a way to cover their losses and stay profitable. The hearing results in no changes which set a precedent for market makers to manipulate the market in a way that impacts retail globally. Etc.

Best case scenario: tendies üíéüôå

That‚Äôs the spectrum we are looking at. Evaluate what we know, dig for what we don‚Äôt, make a thesis, and try proving yourself wrong. 

However, stay true to your fact-based beliefs.

‚ö†Ô∏è VERY IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è What will happen when squeeze happens? It will be a Short Squeeze Festival! üíéü§≤ üöÄ üåõ ‚ú®,"They have lied to our faces about covering short positions, Short Interest etc. We don't have a proper reporting to see the actual float or shares currently held by investors. They are trying get smart with book keeping and hiding all that naked shorted shares.

However my investments are all about trusting my thesis and my calculation. My estimate says short interest could be more than 250% and there is nothing left in the float. So what will happen during the short squeeze? Those mother fckers need to buy the entire outstanding shares 3 times if my calculations are right.  Even if I'm wrong they need to buy the entire outstanding shares more than once. Now that's not float,  they probably need to buy the float several times.

If I'm right we will see a short squeeze that's going to last for days. That's right! We will have a short squeeze Festival! Plenty of time to watch the show while eating popcorn.  Whats even interesting is let's say no one wants to sell, then #GME could be in a situation similar to bitcoin.  Price will Rise, Rise , Rise..

$GME could be the next $TSLA (based on short interest),"I am someone who was long time bullish on $TSLA and saw it jump to $800 (pre-split). Then the pandemic came and $TSLA dropped to &lt; $200 (This is when I started losing on my investment). Seeing that the  pandemic is going to continue for a while and that there are more downsides than upsides, I decided to sell it &lt; $200. 

A few months later, $TSLA jumped to  $1700 (pre-split) and I was fuming. I had underestimated how long short squeezes can last and can hold. I cannot tell you enough about the regret of missing out. I was bullish, I held for 3 years, when everyone said it's going to fail, and then give it all away for no profit cause I underestimated short squeeze. The regret to see it would have returned 2000% had I held onto it for a few more months. Believe me, I am having the  same feelings with GME. 

For all those disheartened by the GME evolution. Hold on to the shares for the love of God. I have 249@133 and I am going to hold on this time. Until the short interest drops to 0, and even after.

Just a recommendation to everyone...,"Many of you have surely heard about lottery winners going bankrupt not long after they've won. I see a lot of posts about what people are planning to do with their money if we do indeed come out on top with this.

My recommendation is to not go on spending sprees and giving it away to everyone. If we do go to the moon, and I really hope we do, I plan to reinvest some of it (depending on how much the market is affected). Most of it would go into building a passive income. 

If I do come into a lot of money, I would like to help out those around me, but I'll do that with the passive income. Otherwise it'll all be gone soon enough. Try to be smart about what you do with your money and hiring a specialist to help you manage it may be a good idea.

And don't forget about taxes!

"/u/DeepFuckingValue likely doubled down his position TODAY, helping to keep the price above $40 and ensure Melvin's huge put position expired worthless.","I know the FUD was all bullshit anyway, but it's still nice the Melvin got further fucked today.

Anyway, DFV's previous update on Feb 3 had his cost basis with 50k shares at $14.89.

Today's update with 100k shares, cost basis at $26.80.  Using these two figures, we can calculate that the cost basis for his NEW 50k shares purchase was $38.71.  To my knowledge the price never reached that low before today.

If you check the charts, the price reached that amount at approx. 2:55PM EST.  Also, during that time there is a large increase in purchase volume.

So that's likely when DFV made his huge double down play.  Thereby helping to kick off a surge that ensured the priced ended above $40 and further giga-fucking Melvin Capital's Put position.

What an absolute baller


As a side note, I feel really bad in a way for DFV, he probably never wanted to be the face of this shit.  He just liked the stock.  The fact that he is willing to double down with all the shit, FUD, and spotlight on him over the last two weeks.  It is really amazing, we should all be forever grateful for what he's done.

My predictions for tomorrow,"Hello my fellow ape holders üêíüêí. Is aluminium-hat time!!

&amp;#x200B;

TL.DR at bottom‚¨á‚¨á‚¨á

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe we are overseeing a fact:  A bunch of apes have been reporting problems of withdrawing money from RH, problems transferring positions to another brokers and shit like that.

&amp;#x200B;

And this got me thinking:

&amp;#x200B;

**1¬∫ Rohinhood**: is self-awareness about itself being doom beyond repair and they are going to be sued and fined to oblivion to fail to fullfil fiduciary duty during the squeeze or now for usury.

In fact, I consider the institution a Bank Run situation if it wasn't by the fact US accounts are covered by SIPC, and because millionaire people doesn't have an account with *Invest, the Graphic Game,* so no major worries here, really the worst scenario would be fresh *brrr* money for all my apes.

&amp;#x200B;

**2¬∫ The capital raised from ""Private Investors"":**

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/robinhood-fundraising.html)

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/robinhood-raises-an-additional-2-4-billion-from-its-investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/robinhood-raises-an-additional-2-4-billion-from-its-investors)

&amp;#x200B;

So 3.4 Billion dolars in record time. For what? Well, I think this is in fact a temporal private bail-out from Citadel and the shorts in order to buy more time.

Time which I think is going to be used by Citadel and the shorts to orchestrate a mayor -7% day in SPY at 10:00 ET tomorrow the 18th, in order to terrorize the politics, to no be ""harsh"" with the questions and to not let DFV talk too much.

**If** shorts lose tomorrow , there will be a retaliation (voluntary or not) in a way of another -15% dip intraday in SPY, due to selling collateral in order to start unwinding the positions if it has really really get south for the shorts. (For example Citadel could destroy TSLA (-5%) with the 3% possition it has recently disclosed via SEC filings, selling it all at once and fucking SPY big time ; or any other relevant and/or boomer stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**3¬∫ Surprises could happen:**

Tomorrow, ( Vlad, crying ) *""DTCC called me in Jan 26th about how they discovered about the short squeeze thing. They  ran some ALGOS to know how hypothetical could go the squeeze get"" .*

(risk management doing risk management shit, unlike RH's ü§°ü§°ü§°)

*""Being the results of said ALGOS, the default of the DTCC and therefore the entire stock market in US.""*

 (and the landing in Pluto by the ape gang).

*""So my only option was* ***to stop the buy botton*** *and let the shorts unwind positions. I didn't wanted to, because I truly formed this company under the commitment to help trading people; but DTCC keep calling me in the 28th: ""Vlad, do it, is at 350""."" Vlad, do it, is at 375."" ""Vlad, do it is at 400""... Until i give the order to block Buy in GME and similar volatile stocks"".*

&amp;#x200B;

I do believe this because I think i'm good reading people and  the CNBC's ( I think it was there) interview, wasn't a triumphant person; was a person jacked to the tits in fear and so much sleep-deprived he can't even looks anxious.

So i think know he only just go along with the Citadel's torrent in order to minimize damage from the altogether Short thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**4¬∫ How could this have got so fucking south for RH:**

&amp;#x200B;

Oh well, lets suppose I¬¥m a greedy fuck (Citadel), and I present you (Vlad) the way to make cheap trading and offer 0 commissions to your clients under the following squeme and under the following logic.

1 - We will pick some securities which will be overshorted by us on propose (For simplicity I will only refer to GME but could go the same for AMC, BBBY, etc...

2 - I, as your maker maker will serve you and fill your order.

3 - I bet on GME going bankrupt because reasons.

4 - If people spontaneously wants to buy GME in bulk numbers, it would drive the stock price up; and because I¬¥m overshorting it I can not let this happens.

5 - When i get an order to complete regarding GME, instead of buying the stock as the ask and bet let me do under the spread minus my commission, i will write you an IOU even when there are shares available. AND I WILL NO BUY SHIT.

Instead of me (Citadel), buying in the market one share of GME to fullfil my duty for with you, i will write and Internal IOU, in which it does grant.

If I sell 100% IOUs, the DTCC or other brokers (direct clearing aside from DTCC) would stop trading with me; because,well i¬¥m not using shares.

For this reason I will keep deep ITM calls / shares lower to the 5% of market cap (in order to be underradar of SEC) to be able for me, Citadel, to convert internally the IOU¬¥s to shares in order to be able to sell shares, as I want to own the least amount possible and generate the lower volume posible.

6 - This is a sum-zero game in which if enough volume is sustained, (not price),  i will be forced to buy more shares at a speed which will drive price up; auto-squeezing myself in the process. Unless i want to start selling 100% IOUs.

*Processing img qo9duvbcp3i61...*

&amp;#x200B;

**5¬™ You have hold too hard... this doesn¬¥t make any sense!  - How does it fit in the chart.**

Well, as what Citadel needs is GME to go bankrupt and a buffer of shares to keep doing this shit; i think they did in fact bought the 2¬∫spike in order to execute calls for themselves in enough quantities ( but under 5%, just 4,9/4,8% ); in order to:

 A-Short sell without improving borrow rates

 B-Keep a buffer for expected-from-beginning purposes of IOU-ing with Robinhood.

&amp;#x200B;

They knew the retailer side (as they knew thanks to be a MM which buys data) was simply halt, and the other brokers would not oppose that much enthusiasm as ape gang; so they didn¬¥t hesitate to put themselves in that apparent risk even thought they never were (hide on plain sight).

&amp;#x200B;

**6¬™ Why?** 

Oh dear, I truly believe they didn¬¥t at all see al of this coming; they didn¬¥t fear RC, DFV, and let alone a bunch of diamond handed apes.

From the beginning they are in a possition very profitable as long as it doesn't go out of hand; because if it does break lose; really shit will hit the fan. I¬¥m speaking RH busted, Citadel causing -15% dip, and DTCC doing margin calls to all brokers at the same time because VIX &gt;60%. (Remember they are on margin as long as the settlement doesn¬¥t need a collateral of 100% as long as VIX gives time to DTCC-brokers to settle said share value. No time equals to throw coal to the engine non-stop or it bursts.

&amp;#x200B;

The think is as follows, what would happen if Vlad says so?

What happens if this, as crazy as it sounds, was in did what did happened?:

 \-Some brokers would want to buy shares of the companies (remember they are a lot), because then if they get filled; would mean the shorts would buy the very same share at an absurd price. So the arbitrage would intensify AF.

 \-Some brokers would want to sells because:

A - They need to unwind the defaulted shorts, fear squeeze and do self-prophecy shit.

B - They want to play the chair game and arbitrage on the affected shorts, so need collateral to buy .

&amp;#x200B;

**7¬∫ What is the play?**

If i could buy , (Europoor here, all my apes love derivatives, fuck EU regulations) I would:

 \-Calls on VIX on max pain 19/2.

 \-800 1dte 19/2.

 \-380 19/2 SPY put.

 \-Calls on TLT for VIX sustitute.

 \-Shit-truck load of GME shares (Could work any securitie blocked by RH, but i would say the best is GME).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even if this happens at a low scale and doesn¬¥t trigger the squoze, or doesn¬¥t happen at all; it will be my personal theory as long as we don¬¥t know exactly what did in fact happen and where are the shares.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand - The man that is supposed to be professional, intelligent and classy show's fear in his words. When you read Gabriel Plotkins speech and realise it holds no weight he Hides Behind his religion, race and culture. Instead of defending his position or telling more about himself he attacks redditors and thus some retail investors for allegedly being Anti-Semitic. Is this the person we should be afraid of? A man who hides behind his culture, a man who cannot take individual responsibility for his actions? No.

On the other hand - The manipulator of stocks, the man who orchestrated the financial attack on billionaires is... Just a regular guy. Just a regular guy who made a good investment after tons of researching, spoke about it on the internet and became a millionaire which meant a lot to him and his family.

Vlad testimony question,"‚ÄúAt approximately 5:11 a.m. EST on January 28, the NSCC sent Robinhood Securities an automated notice stating that Robinhood Securities had a deposit deficit of approximately $3 billion.

Between 6:30 and 7:30 am EST, the Robinhood Securities operations team made the decision to impose trading restrictions on GameStop and other securities. In conversations with NSCC staff early that morning, Robinhood Securities notified the NSCC of its intention to implement these restrictions and also informed the NSCC of the margin restrictions that had already been imposed. NSCC initially notified Robinhood Securities that it had reduced the excess capital premium charge by more than half.

Then, shortly after 9:00 am EST, NSCC informed Robinhood Securities that the excess capital premium charge had been waived entirely for that day and the net deposit requirement was approximately $1.4 billion, nearly ten times the amount required just days earlier on January 25. Robinhood Securities then deposited approximately $737 million with the NSCC that, when added to the $696 million already on deposit, met the revised deposit requirement for that day‚Äù

Can anyone explain how the discovery of XRT ultimately impacts GME? Is a squeeze still possible?,"Can anyone explain a bit what it means now that we know about XRT? Everyone is posting that this is reassuring and that we found the shorts and everything; which is great, I love it. I'm so happy we figured this out, and I'm hoping this has huge implications for a rise on GME

But what does this mean for GME? Like, is it still possible to trigger a squeeze since the shorts aren't directly on GameStop anymore? I've never really experienced a situation like this before. What situation would cause the GME stock to rise in price? I feel like this discovery can't possibly be good for the hedges, since if this was a thing then no squeezes would ever happen: Hedge funds could just jump ships to an ETF and stay there forever.

From my understanding, We can't go all-in on XRT and trigger a squeeze since it's an ETF and they can just issue new stocks. Does holding GME / having an extremely low availability of shares still influence a potential squeeze?

* How are GME stocks purchased/sold with the introduction of an ETF like XRT? Like, is XRT purchasing shares of GameStop? Or are they just holding their current % of Gamestop shares. And if that is the case, is there some relationship to the amount of GameStop shares available / the holders and the price?
* Also, does this mean that the hedges are no longer scrambling to cover their positions? Like we were all saying before how the hedges are paying millions every day in interest by not covering their positions, but is this still happening?
* Can hedges infinitely delay covering their positions now that they're in on XRT? I don't see how this can be a thing, since if it was then every single hedge fund would be doing this, and no squeezes would ever happen.
* What does the massive amount of failure-to-delivers on XRT mean for GameStop?

have you read Melvin's testimony?,"I paste just a piece  


 In January 2021, a group on Reddit began to make posts about Melvin‚Äôs specific investments. They took information contained in Melvin‚Äôs SEC filings and encouraged others to trade in the opposite direction. Many of these posts were laced with antisemitic slurs directed at me and others. The posts said things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can‚Äôt keep getting away with this.‚Äù Others sent similarly profane and racist text messages to me. In the frenzy during January, GameStop‚Äôs stock rose from $17 to a peak of $483. I do not think anyone would claim that that price had any relationship to the intrinsic value of the company. The unfortunate part of this episode is that ordinary investors who were convinced by a misleading frenzy to buy GameStop at $100, $200, or even $483 have now lost significant amounts.

"Before any rockets launch, learn how to handle money well so your life WILL be changed if we fly past the moon.","This post is something I hope everyone on this forum reads BEFORE the stock goes through the roof. The reason this is so important is because over 80% of lottery winners are bankrupt within a decade of winning. 

If you have a job, please take a few weeks/months before you quit, and take that time to learn how to handle money well. Learn to budget, save, invest (properly), and do the right thing with money.

How I see it is GME is like that Lottery game that a couple did the math and found out they could promise winnings...so they risked their house and everything to buy as much as they could. Profit 80k. They did it again and again until the had made millions from it. Then they began helping their whole town grow their money until the game closed down.

GME is one of those things. It‚Äôs still a gamble, but all the math and DD that I‚Äôm seeing points to it being inevitable to go up. Idk if that‚Äôs 5k, 12k, or 69,420/share...but I BELIEVE that it will go up.*

Learn now what to do with your money, make a plan NOW, and then shoot for that goal. I‚Äôd recommend looking up a tax pro before you transfer your funds from fidelity (or other platform) to your bank account.

Numbers are either old or rely on self-reporting (FINRA). Also, I still use my fingers to do math so don‚Äôt trust me with them anyway. HOWEVER, lets recap the history. Shorts were abusing this stock and had shorted it to roughly 138% of the float. TIME TRAVELLER DFV and other OG‚Äôs saw the long play in this OVER A YEAR OUT and yolo‚Äôd on a hope and a dream. People shot him down left and right but he diamond handed that shit and believed in his DD of the company being undervalued and having good long term potential. Bullish price point WITHOUT A SQUEEZE of $1**69** ([nice](https://www.gmedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GMEdd-GameStopValuation-20Jan21.pdf)).

Week of Jan 4th GME has been brewing for awhile now and been battling a SP in the teens for MONTHS. Things appear to have been [set in motion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l21pwh/gme_gang_on_the_subject_of_the_golden_bridge_and/) on Dec 24th. HF shitbags have the [hubris](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1344687817998401537) to [believe](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934?s=20) they can thread a needle blindfolded during takeoff on a rocket to Alpha Centauri all while snorting blow and jacking each other off.

Jan 11th Papa Cohen takes a board position galvanizing the resolve of the bet. Start of week opens $19. HF were battling WSB autists who finally began to see the divine light of DFV‚Äôs play with end of week close at $35. The week of the 18th saw all the bullshit with ‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs [lamest outlaw](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2009448/hong-kong-finds-citron-researchs-andrew-left)‚Äù and Shitron and their artificial attempt to deflate the stock ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sowwy I forgot about the inauguration livestream cancelled‚Äù baseless accusations of death threats etc. WSB OG‚Äôs smell the bullshit and lay in hard against Shitron‚Äôs weak $20 price forecast.

All the energy in this stock results in a gamma squeeze on the 22nd as every single fucking call option (60c highest) comes ITM forcing Call writers to purchase shares in order to fill their contracts sold driving up the price even further. Bears R fuk etc etc.

Jan 25th yours truly enters the game 10@97 after learning about wtf was going on over the weekend. NORMALLY I‚Äôm a modest gambler, always set a [stop loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9yL5usLFgY), take profit regularly blah blah boring bullshit. I was following WSB religiously now and saw someone mention ‚Äútake off your stop losses HF are trying to snipe them‚Äù. I took a bet and listened and LO AND BEHOLD that person was right! Shit tanked to 61 only to recover (where I copped some more in power hour now a true believer) ultimately closing at 148 the next goddamn day!

As we‚Äôre approaching the end of the week all the highest OTM calls at [115](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4mshy/gme_options_chain_update_gamma_squeeze_and_new/) are due to expire ITM AGAIN thereby paving the way for another fucking gamma squeeze (Contributing reason for why shit was surging to $500 premarket on the 28th). But [RH and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/l7mi9t/nyc_protesters_slam_robinhood_scream_at_wall/gl7xh70/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=) halt buying just as the MOASS Rocket is taking off... Tinfoil hat time‚Ä¶

On the 28th that POS Thomas Peterffy speaking on behalf of DTCC ‚Äì Interactive brokers goes on CNBC and says THE QUIET PART [OUT LOUD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM&amp;t=4s) ‚ÄúWe Shut down buying to protect ourselves‚Äù. DTCC flexes its muscle to increase margin on RH ( 3 Billion) and have others like Apex halt buys to save their own skins. **Retail be damned**. This is the buy block out and if you look at the historical trading data you‚Äôll notice that the price drops precipitously over the next few days while the shorts are supposedly covering (that dog don‚Äôt hunt though, if they were covering the price should‚Äôve been going up). Now on the 28th I personally got pissed and got another 5 shares at 380 through another broker because I unfortunately got mad and emotional about how we were all getting royally screwed.

\-Side note allegedly on the 29th someone or someones known as ‚Äú[The Viking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8y27e/gme_viking_to_the_rescue/)‚Äù Twitter  
handle KJETILL STJERNE (handle currently being held by some kid out of respect) fought hella  
hard against the artificial price deflation. Last they were heard from was 2/2, there is plausibility  
to this story of heroism, but ultimately unconfirmed.

The week of 2/1 the price tanks on increasingly lower volume while shills pump nonsense like SLV on all the forums with the newly minted ‚ÄúReddit Army‚Äù boogeyman being squawked about all over tv. Also, if you look at the charts for price action related to volume during individual days you‚Äôll notice that price is increasing on increased volume (an indicator of [legitimate positive](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/02/010702.asp#:~:text=Trading%20volume%20is%20a%20measure,many%20contracts%20have%20changed%20hands) price movement for GameStonk). WSB subreddit has the coup by old mods trying to cash in and what seems to be a major FUD push with shit feeling increasingly astroturfed in the subreddit. ALL IN 1 WEEK!

\- Double side note GME OG @ RodAlzmann (Hi Rod!) has his twitter hacked 2/6

Week of 2/8 after months of consistent moderate gains Weed stocks screech out of the sky mooning and tanking over the course of 2 days. Thankfully good WSB mods seem to be at the helm again, but it‚Äôs still difficult to get trustworthy info. Look, I don‚Äôt think retail has that kind of capital to cause such abrupt price movements out of the blue. What was the catalyst?? Good news for pot came on 2/1 from Schumer a week prior to the surge we just saw, fishy AF. My smooth brain knew it mattered couldn‚Äôt understand what was important about the [tight butthole](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lczltc/gme_what_todays_data_shows/) $50-$53 range these past three days. Other redditors whose brains are not as smooth as mine did amazing DD fleshing out [hypothesis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) regarding [FTD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/li7uz2/gme_itm_open_interest_for_212_more_market_fuckery/) (a [MONTH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqf2g8/gme_gang_failures_to_deliver_prepost_wsb_wsb/) AGO), [Naked](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lhta3u/a_historical_survey_of_the_systemic_problem_of/) Shorts and how that supports people saying ‚ÄúThe squeeze [hasn‚Äôt Squoze](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj8gh1/upcoming_week_219_geee_em_eeee_itm_options/)‚Äù, the [Squozening part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lglvoy/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_3/). I buy it and now have 49 DCA 98.

MY HYPOTHESIS: HF got caught with their pants down and their dick in the cookie jar by retail. Consistent gamma squeezes had hedge funds crying and feeling emasculated. This fight isn‚Äôt just about money for them but for their way of life. Why TF would some other wealthy person give their money to a HF to babysit when that money could be easily lost to a bunch of basement dwellers like us. They need to tank WSB credibility, they need to ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù retail investors with fear by pumping and dumping other shit and blasting GME to oblivion because if they can‚Äôt scare people into giving them their own money to manage then they lose all their credibility and way of life. So lets get that money, make sure to trim that bush and cover your initial investment, house money is the best way to play.

Robinhood says my GME shares not bought on margin will not be lent out. I am not a RH fan by any means but this info may be helpful to you.,"Obligatory I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Like many others I signed up for Robinhood during the January buzz for GME, but I was in very slightly earlier than some so I understood thanks to info on WSB before it went to shit that before I started buying I should sign up for the Gold trial and turn off margin.

I sent them an email a few days ago saying that I bought shares with cash using the Instant Deposit feature, and that  I specifically didn't want my shares purchased with cash once the deposit period had cleared to be lent out to brokers for short selling purposes.

I got no response and eventually a follow-up email asking if I had resolved my issue. Uh, no, I hadn't. So I said that and got this response yesterday:

**""First, I want to reassure you that your securities are not currently being loaned out.**¬†

**We may loan out securities if you borrow funds from Robinhood, as is standard industry practice. However, in your case, since you haven‚Äôt borrowed funds from Robinhood, your securities are not being loaned out.""**

Could the short interest be at 200-210%?,"I have been reading more on the XRM news, that were posted around Jan 30 To Feb 3. Some cite that the ETF was shorted 642% up from 630% days before. I found that on their page the ETF states having ~350k GME shares. They shorted the whole fund (95 other stocks included) over 600% to get the underlying shares. Thats 350k*6.42 = 2.25M shares that they got from one fund. So if their original SI% dropped from 144 to 78 in that specific period. Perhaps they didnt actually buy up that amount, they just borrowed more. That they actually owe back to the etf now. Meaning the 66% of SI they covered is not bought from share holders but borrowed from an etf, repeatedly counting the same shares.  
Why borrow gme instead of buying if shorting is 3x more expensive this way. What perhaps you cant actually find shares? What apes not giving banana back for cheap?  
Also why the fuck are you shorting the entire ETF with 95 other shares, just to get 1 out of 96 shares? What are they hard to find otherwise?

"So if it‚Äôs true the HF‚Äôs are hiding their shorts in XRT and the rate is 5%+, the HF‚Äôs when they see they the gif is up, they should probably close their short positions due to the rate being 3 times higher then that of the interest on GME?","I am no expert by any means but I‚Äôve been reading what everyone has been posting/sharing of the XRT charts matching those of GME and AMC.  If this is true and by the DD being shown and the identical charts, one would think the HF‚Äôs would do one of the following:

1: move shorts to another ETF?

2: close out positions of their shorts since the interest in an ETF are 3 times more expensive?

HODL . Diamond hands.

Buy if you want/can afford more.

GME DD - Some option contract numbers,"Hello fellow bonobos,

Here's some random charts indicating data that might tickle tism amongst the more special apes amongst you. Sorry for not being able to make this data more digestible for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img sv0ukrlgqph61...*

Basically we need to finish the next several weeks above $50 for these to expire worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[This chart indicates Put Strikes on the left and total amount of money spent on those contracts on the right. \(1=1k\)](https://preview.redd.it/lwkrrspsqph61.png?width=3113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27c9f7c9614708b8a62b960fa2a613ce1c054576)

The right side is logarithmic e.g any red lines above the 1000 value are likely around within the 2mil - 3mil range in terms of money spent to buy these contracts. There is 1 anomalous reading that differs from everything else at the 19/3/2021 (EU Date Format) where there have been 3000 contracts purchased at a strike price of $100 for around $3 million. These are quite an anomaly because all other data indicates the majority of puts being at $50 and below with the exception of a few between $50-75.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Based on the amounts of contracts \(blue\), you can see a large amount of puts expiring on the 19'th of Feb.](https://preview.redd.it/vt2fm6vtsph61.png?width=2699&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=165b21e7d7d01551e8579c3a9144e18100512ddb)

You can see that the hedge funds or retail has had $2mln worth of puts (2.4 million shares) expire worthless last week. If we end this current week (16-19 Feb) above 50, another $1.4 mil in puts (\~4 million shares) expire worthless and out of the money.

Interestingly, there's not much option activity set for the START and END of march. Suggestions on what this could mean are welcome in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img b4z6k253uph61...*

You can see the disparity between Calls and Puts like on the 27'th, 29'th Jan and strangely on the 10'th Feb. Hopefully this data tells you something else as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ooh84cgwuph61...*

Unfortunately it was not possible to include strike prices here as the data would become a lot more complicated and maybe too hard for some apes to understand.

&amp;#x200B;

They crushed GME stock price down 77% on low volume and stopped the epic short squeeze.,"On what was supposed to be the epic short squeeze day with GME trading at 530 pre-market, the DTCC, which cleared the naked GME short positions in excess of 100% of available shares for the Hedge Funds, forced brokers to ban buying the stocks which they themselves allowed to be sold short to oblivion.

New FUD Strategy?,"So recently I have seen some threads bashing the threads with sell prices that are really high.

I have a feeling the new FUD tactic are threads like these, or I might be high on crayons. I have been seeing this shit pop up for a few days with crap like Diamond hands is bad, who started calling us apes? There is no army and now this

Although i agree with the sentiment that people just buy the stock because they believe in it and not because of nefarious reasons.

However, this seems to be taking it a little too far. Almost like they want people to stop trusting each other, trying to sow discord.

Looking at his comment history, he seemed to be awfully obsessed with getting people to sell this stock @ $400. Market Manipulation?

Also, Account created on Jan 25 2021.

Just because someone says they are going to do something does not mean you have to follow them, or that they are going to do it. Posting a thread saying that you want to sell @ $X does not mean other people will follow or that you will sell @ $X. Some might even interpret it as a joke, maybe it actually is a joke. 

They are making this out to be a bigger deal than it actually is. Perhaps trying to purposefully misinterpret things?

Also, there were a few threads last week saying that bots were being used to get the prices of shares so these high prices could just be said to counter that.

This is just speculation at this point so yeah. Maybe I have been eating too much crayons. 

Please do not go and bash this guy, as he might really be doing it out of genuine concern. I don't know I am a REALLY retarded ape.

How is a mega squeeze possible?,"I don't hold a position, but just legiy curious about this whole gme situation. 

Everyone keeps talking about going to the moon, but even if HFs were trapped, how would they afford to pay every holder crazy amounts per share (e.g. 1k, 5k, 10k, etc)? Wouldn't they be forced to just go into bankrupcy before paying anything out or leave someone else holding the bag? 

In either case, I'm still trying to understand how anyone would be able to afford to pay shareholders what they want. Would there just be some kind of settlement? If so, wouldn't the ""buyout"" be more conservative like $100 or $200 per share?

"GME - Reshorted to pay old shorts, changed price manipulation tactics","Could they have reshorted at the top of the spike, but instead of selling those shares to short the price they used them to repay the original shorted shares to hide the problem?  And then they used the XRT and other EFT's shorting to drive the price down, hoping to induce a panic sell, dropping the price down to their original level of shorts, allowing them to break even?

I owe 1million shares at $4.  Price is going through the roof.  Retail starts buying in mass increasing the price.  They halt trading and start shorting XRT and other EFT's to drop the price.  They reborrow 1 million shares at top of chart to kick the can down the road.  Borrow 1 million shares at $400, and use those 1 million shares to payback the $4 shares.  People see the price starting to go down due to shorting of other ETF's, and some sell thinking the squeeze has squooze, driving the price down even lower.  

Diamond handed apes start buying up the shares on the way down and flatline at $50.  They can't get the price below $50.  Even if they close they still lose $46 per share, and cause a massive increase which they are not willing to do.   

TLDR

They Did not double down, they faked the covering by reshorting at the height of the price, and moved to a cloaking device (ETF's that hold GME while going long on other ETF holdings) to continue manipulating the price while making it look like the shorts have been covered.

A conservative count of synthetic long positions created to disguise short positions in late January [DD],"[Synthetic long positions were created to disguise short positions](https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lil1c7/a_very_simple_but_very_convincing_reason_that/), but without counting these synthetic long positions, it is difficult to determine how many shorts were disguised. Luckily, creating a conservative count of how many of these synthetic long positions is easy with options flow data. Contrary to what investopedia implies, [the strike price for the put and call doesn't have to be at the money](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/synthetic-long-stock/), and [with a split strike strategy](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/synthetic-long-stock-split-strikes.aspx) (riskier, but still gives the appearance of covering), the synthetic long doesn't even have to have the same strike price for the call and put. 

Using historical option flow data (I used [MarketChameleon](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/GME/OptionTrades/); they have a seven-day free trial if you want to do this too), we can calculate how many synthetic longs were created each day between January 19 and January 29 (trading dates included in the most recent FINRA report) by finding pairs of puts sold and calls bought at the same millisecond, and which together have the same quantity, expiration, and--in the case of standard synthetic long shares--strike price. We can also determine how much it cost hedge funds to disguise those shares by looking at the sum of the notional for the bought calls minus the sum of the notional for the sold puts. You can find the main part of my R syntax for this [here](https://pastebin.com/ryKUeQAK).

In this analysis, I've included both synthetic shares that expire the short report after next (i.e., after 2/15; I would guess that hedge funds might want to make it look like they covered for at least a month without having to re-buy anything, in hopes that retail might give up and start selling) as well as those that expired the day of the 1/29 short report (which would give the same appearance of covering for the 1/29 report at a cheaper price, though these synthetic shares would have to be bought again later).

Here's a table of the results summary:

|Synthetic Long Strategy|Total Money Spent on Synthetic Share Creation|Total Number of Synthetic Shares Created|Total Money Spent on Synthetic Shares Expiring After 2/15|Total Number of Synthetic Shares Expiring After 2/15|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shared Strikes|$63,872,357|2,181,700|$42,229,116|1,038,100|
|Split Strikes|$84,264,308|3,488,200|$57,097,675|1,604,900|
|Either (total)|$148,136,665|5,669,900|$99,326,791|2,643,000|

The split strikes strategy bought slightly more shares per dollar (0.038 shares/dollar for split strikes vs. 0.034 shares/dollar for the shared strike strategy) here, so it makes sense that they would have used it in some cases; it's slightly more risk, but they're already risking a lot by not covering. That's a ***ton*** of money to only *disguise* a short position. However, it makes financial sense for them to take that risk, because the money to disguise that position is *less than a tenth* of what would have been needed to cover those shares at $300/share (\~$1.7 billion). 

&amp;#x200B;

For those who want it, here's a breakdown by day of all synthetic long shares created (shared strike or split). Negative money means selling the put provided more money than buying the call, so creating the synthetic long netted them money those days: 

|Day|Money Spent Per Day on Synthetic Share Creation|Number of Synthetic Shares Created Per Day|Money Spent Per Day on Synthetic Shares Expiring After 2/15|Number of Synthetic Shares Created Per Day Expiring After 2/15|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1/19|\-$1,865,907|499,100|\-$1,892,806|457,200|
|1/20|\-$165,131|232,700|\-$207,843|200,600|
|1/21|\-$315,896|400,300|\-$406,093|361,300|
|1/22|$6,202,694|601,000|$5,215,119|459,900|
|1/25|$4,187,296|520,300|$2,450,140|139,100|
|1/26|$19,722,838|2,241,500|$10,059,848|466,900|
|1/27|$38,809,234|239,300|$30,872,059|171,000|
|1/28|$78,234,635|576,200|$56,790,916|308,300|
|1/29|$3,326,902|359,500|\-$3,554,549|78,700|

&amp;#x200B;

Now, **I want to emphasize that this method does not count what appear to be most of the synthetic longs by circumstantial evidence**. This is because any synthetic longs created at separate times, with different call vs. put quantities, or at different expiration dates. I *know* this method misses some synthetic calls, because the subset of option orders that meet the same execution time, same quantity, and same expiration date criteria does not include the \~[11,800,000 shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME&amp;date=1642723200) in open interest for the GME $0.50p 1/21/22 (or any of the other GME $0.50 puts, all of which have absurd open interest), and [these shares are almost assuredly short legs of synthetic share positions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/li7tfi/were_gme_shorts_covering_between_jan_22_and_jan_27/). So this count of synthetic shares created should be considered a *conservative* count. It is likely that there are far more synthetic longs created than can be determined conclusively using options flow.

&amp;#x200B;

# What does all of this mean?

Brief recap for those who don't want to read above: These options flow data allow us to estimate how many shorted shares are able to be disguised using synthetic long positions. Although it is possible that some of these synthetic long positions were not used to disguise short positions, the massive uptick (not shown) in synthetic long positions from January of 2020 to January of 2021 indicate that the overwhelming majority of these synthetic longs are likely being used to disguise shorts. In addition, although much more definitive, options flow data miss a number of likely synthetic long positions (such as those that appear to be using the GME $0.50 puts). 

These data indicate that **shorts have paid** ***at least*** **$148 million simply to** ***hide*** **their short position**, and with every options expiration date, they will need to roll their synthetic longs expiring on that date out to the next date to keep their position hidden. This is not an enormous amount of money (especially considering [many different hedge funds are short GME](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-funds-gamestop-analysi-idUSKBN2A00NI)), but it's sizeable enough that they can't keep hiding their short position forever. Eventually, the cost of continuing to hide their short position will outweigh their foreseeable cost of covering it, and a hedge fund will cover. That will presumably start a domino effect. Who knows.

The second thing that these data indicate is that there are *at least* around 5.5 million more shares of GME shorted than the official data show. When the 5.5 million shares are added to the reported 21.41 million shares shorted, short interest of float (float defined as Yahoo Finance and Morningstar define it: outstanding shares - insider holdings - untradeable institutional holdings), **excluding masking by synthetic longs, short interest of float is** ***at least*** **99.23%**. Keep in mind that these option flow data miss a lot of apparent (but not conclusive) synthetic longs. *And this is not even considering the* [*1+ million shares synthetically shorted via shorted ETFs*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ljwo3v/serious_researchers_needed_now_i_think_i_know/gnhg06f) (see also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lkgrhe/xrt_shorts_mapped_to_gmes_chart/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/)). 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** Shorts are paying a lot (around $150 million, rolling) to hide their position, and *short interest of float is at least 99.23%*. It is likely much higher, because I have used options flow data to only very conservatively count synthetic long positions (the call and put orders had to be filled at the same millisecond for the same quantity at the same expiration date). Shorts will eventually determine that paying to continue to hide their short position costs more for the foreseeable future than covering, and either quickly or slowly, they will start to cover. It costs us nothing to hold, and shorts are currently paying hundreds of millions simply to hide their position.

Illegal Tactics and DTCC/Prime Broker Complicity In Naked Shorting &amp; Retail Shutdown of GME (DTCC/Prime Brokers decision makers need to be questioned at the 2/18 GameStop Congress hearing),"**TLDR: GameStop‚Äôs Congress hearing is on Feb 18th, they need to investigate the Prime Brokers and DTCC for their complicity in enabling naked shorting within GME and by extension, potential collusion to shut down trading on Jan 28th, the day the short squeeze was going to kick off.** (stick to the end for an analysis of some illegal tactics short side hedge funds have been using)

Thesis: On the day the retail market for GME shut down on 1/28 (the day the short squeeze would‚Äôve happened had there been no market intervention), DTCC (clearing house monopoly) shut down retail buying in order to protect itself and Prime Brokers **(which privately own the DTCC)** from being exposed to the consequences of being party to illegal activity. I believe Prime Brokers and DTCC need to be called to the GameStop hearing on February 18th to be questioned for their complicity in enabling illegal naked shorting of the GME stock, as well as potential collusion to shut out retail buyers on 1/28.

In my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/) (which I recommend reading for some context) I explored the subject of rampant illegal naked shorting in GME, and how Prime Brokers (consisting of banks like Goldman, Morgan, etc) and DTCC would be complicit in the naked shorting. This in turn raises the thought experiment that they would be incentivized to do anything possible to prevent the short squeeze from happening on 1/28 because had the short squeeze happened, the shorts would go bankrupt and their Prime Brokers who lent them their naked shorted shares would need to cover the shares. This would not only represent a humongous capital expense for Prime Brokers, the culpability of Prime Brokers (and that of the DTCC) in this situation would also have likely been exposed as well.

A quick primer on what a Prime Broker is: Prime Brokers are essentially the service side of the short- selling business. They lend out securities and cash, you can think of them as the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù in a casino: They provide a gambler with markers to play and to manage his winnings. According to Matt Taibi, ‚ÄúUnder the original concept, if a hedge fund that wanted to short a stock they would first need to ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock with his Prime Broker but as time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and ‚Äúlocate‚Äù the stock themselves, and what this does is enable short-sellers to sell stock without delivering and thereby perform naked shorts with counterfeit shares. (source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)). (I highly recommend you read[ Matt Taibi‚Äôs article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210213125246/https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/) on naked shorting and how it was used to take down Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. There are so many parallels with GME it‚Äôs hard to miss. It‚Äôs amazing to consider that 12 years after this article was published and brought to public awareness, the problem of naked shorting still exists as a systemic issue.)

Prime Brokers have a long history of being associated with naked shorting. To highlight a few examples, Prime Brokers like Merill Lynch and Goldman have long been implicated for naked shorting Overstock.com ([https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/), [https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx\_lm\_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f](https://www.forbes.com/2007/02/02/naked-short-suit-overstock-biz-cx_lm_0202naked.html?sh=271400d1763f)). Another example is when Goldman‚Äôs Prime Brokerage was implicated by the SEC in 2016 and got away with a small fine of 16 million (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)). An example that very recently came in the news is a story where CIBC, BOA, UBS and TD Bank Prime Brokerages are accused of facilitating naked short selling and using counterfeit stock to attack and bring the stock price of a company from $34.77 to $1.83 (Source: [https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article\_id=224548](https://www.securitiesfinancetimes.com/securitieslendingnews/industryarticle.php?article_id=224548)).

The DTCC also has a very long history of being associated with naked shorting. The Wall Street Journal noted that 1% of the DTCC‚Äôs volume end in failure to deliver which ‚Äú**have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices‚Ä¶ DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.** ‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)). The DTCC has also had numerous complaints submitted to the SEC for enabling naked shorting (source: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/decosta122203.htm)) and have been sued tens or hundreds of times for assisting naked shorts (source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/) and [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) and [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

On 1/28 Robinhood received a letter from the DTCC at 4 am requiring them to halt trading or come up with [3 billion dollars](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/), which Robinhood did not have, and therefore with one swoop of the pen the DTCC shut down buy side momentum but strangely allowed selling. Retail investors were shut out of the market and as any student of microeconomics would know, by shutting buy but only allowing sell, the price is bound to fall. Meanwhile while hedge funds were able to keep trading not only in the market but also [crosstrade in the dark pools](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lghhkv/gamestop_institutional_broker_trades_off_the/) (‚Äúprivate‚Äù stock markets that retail is shut out of, more on this later), and use this crucial lifeline given to them by the DTCC to prevent the squeeze from happening that day.

With retail abruptly being shut out from buy (even cash accounts were shut out, which didn‚Äôt make sense) and only allowed to sell, almost everyone could smell manipulation was afoot (which triggered the Congress hearing) and the most of the blame was pointed at Robinhood. Personally and in hindsight, I believe Robinhood was just a willing scapegoat. When we think about who had the most to lose if a short squeeze occurred, I‚Äôll narrow it down to three entities, Shorts and their stakeholders (ie Citadel), Prime Brokers and the DTCC.

It‚Äôs important to remember that the actual impetus that triggered the shutdown of the market for retail investors came from the DTCC. Working backwards, if you consider that GME was rampantly naked shorted and DTCC and Prime Brokers would have to be complicit in it, I believe the DTCC, Primer Brokers and possibly Citadel (who provides 40% of Robinhood‚Äôs revenue) brazenly manipulated the market on 1/28 by shutting down purchasing for retail buyers to prevent the squeeze from being squoze on that day as doing so would be catastrophic for all aforementioned parties involved. **I believe that on the upcoming Gamestop Congress hearings the Financial Services Committee needs to call on decision makers of DTCC and Prime Brokers explore their role and complicity in the shut out of retail buyers that day as well as being enablers of naked shorting in GME.**

An interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if Prime Brokers had margin had called the shorts, they would presumably also also gone down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call and instead the most logical option would probably would have been to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think most likely happened.

If you‚Äôve read up to this point, you might be thinking what can I do about this? I am aware that there a lot of cynicism that we can‚Äôt do anything, that there will be no justice for retail investors who were harmed this situation, and that institutions and people in power will prevent anything from being done. I feel this sometimes too, but remember:

**A single voice can be drowned out, but if we all speak together then we will make our voice heard. Ape Strong Together.**

With the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing

What follows should probably be a separate post, but I will take the opportunity to summarize some of the illegal tactics that shorts have been identified to be using in their war with retail investors. Note that this may not be an exhaustive list and there may be newer tactics deployed in the future. Retail investors might not have the same tricks, resources and willingness to break the law for profit as hedgies do, but my hope and belief is that if we pool our knowledge and analysis, we will figure out their game and effectively adapt.

Feel free to forward the list below to any representatives and lawmakers if you concur that these tactics were used:

**Rampant Naked Shorting -** With the [extremely high number of Fail to Delivers (FTID](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)) , [short interest being as high as 226% recently](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl), [and institutions alone holding a staggering 177% of the total float](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the) (likely due in large part to counterfeit shares), signs strongly point to GME being rampant with naked shorts and counterfeit shares. I believe the original goal of shorts was to drive GME to bankruptcy with these naked shorts, using [the laddering of naked shorts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) (aka short ladder attack), executed with the help of counterfeit stock which is a classic and reliable method of driving down the stock price. I believe the GME stock has seen relentlessly aggressive short attacks, especially on the week of Monday February 1st, which drove the stock price down and triggered panic selling.

**Ladder Attacks with the help of Dark Pools** \- Another identified method of ladder attacks was identified to come from [crosstrading with darkpools (the stock market has its own private stock exchange where institutions can trade‚Ä¶)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/). Essentially darkpools are private stock markets retail investors do not have access to, where short side funds can purchase securities ‚Äúoff market‚Äù and then sell ‚Äúon-market‚Äù, with the effect of creating a lot more downward pressure on the market without the upward pressure from buying.

**Illegally masking shorts with synthetic longs**. Another tactic shorts are suspected of using in GME is the use of illegally using options to evade short positions in violation of Reg SHO which SEC describes in [this risk alert](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2013-151) and which I elaborate in this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/). Essentially it‚Äôs the use of using options to create synthetic longs to illegally and artificially cover and prolong short positions and at same time obscuring the true short interest %. If you consider that it would be far more profitable for shorts to not cover at high prices but instead ladder attack the price and wait for retail investors to lose interest and close their shorts at as low of a price as possible, then you can see why this strategy would be very effective.

**Using way out-of-money call options to obscure true short interest.** You may have heard about the 43 million worth of 800 dollar calls purchased when the price was 100 and found it odd. [Later it was identified](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lgpim2/shorts_have_not_covered_and_i_have_proof_please/) as a tactic to cheaply purchase synthetic call options (since at 800 its way out of money) to obscure their short positions (with the added benefit of hedging at 800 if a squeeze does happen)

One thing I want to note, particularly to legislators at the GameStop hearing: Retail investors were not incited to pump GME. **Retail investors spotted a unique Short Squeeze opportunity created by the greed of short side hedge funds**, whereby GameStop was being abusively naked shorted with the goal of bringing it to bankruptcy, and hedge funds were so greedy about it that they shorted the company with a short interest of 226% of float, meaning A LOT of counterfeit shares were being used to short the company. **Retail investors saw this as an opportunity to short squeeze the hedge fund shorters, which is a legal and legitimate investment strategy**. The short squeeze would have happened had everyone played fair, but instead, financial institutions who were culpable to the naked shorting intervened and shut down retail buying, hurting the retail investors and successfully manipulating the market. The investment itself was in my opinion a sound decision based on the short squeeze, but in hindsight retail investors did not seriously consider the risk of the market would be blatantly and publicly manipulated and that the market would be rigged against them.

If this post was useful (and I hope it was! Gave up my Friday night to write this for you Apes), please upvote for visibility and share it far and wide. **The GameStop hearings could be a first step and hope towards legislative change, and it‚Äôs extremely important that the right story is told at those hearings (and by the right story I mean the real truth of what happened**.) I hope the truly culpable parties are investigated and brought to justice. Again, I know many of us feel cynical that anything meaning will be done towards finding justice against the lawbreakers in this case, but **if you feel even an ounce of injustice or empathy at how retail investors were unfairly harmed in the course of investing in GME, I strongly urge you to contact a legislator associated with the GameStop hearings and bring this to their attention so they can review this case with more complete information. In addition I recommend you to contact the SEC and any journalist you know or via journalist tip lines. It‚Äôs not going to be easy but the more awareness we raise the higher the likelihood our voices will be heard and positive change will be made.**

As we navigate the rocky waters ahead, I‚Äôll gift you with a favorite quote of mine:

**The only difference between a nightmare and a dream is how big your balls are.**

üöÄüöÄüöÄ

*Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor, I just like the stock.*

Ps. If you‚Äôve read to the end, I‚Äôll leave you with a few more thoughts and reminders:

\- If I were to distill life into one thing, it would be to never lose hope.

\- Remember that if you‚Äôve lost money in any way shape or form, don‚Äôt be depressed, money can always be made back and the important thing is to maintain a good attitude.

\- Only invest what you can afford to lose.

They grind.  They work their face-off.  

Elon Musk used to sleep in cycles - sometimes at work, under his desk, just so he could keep cranking out progress.  Kobe would practice several hours earlier than his teammates on a routine basis.

Why I‚Äôm wary of the ‚ÄúI was messaged to shill‚Äù posts,"We‚Äôve seen some users post that they‚Äôve been messaged to spread negative GME sentiment on this sub. This isn‚Äôt a negative GME post it‚Äôs just a discussion of what these claims would mean and their authenticity.


I‚Äôve looked at these users profiles and they‚Äôve been around for the same two weeks as most of you. They‚Äôre not some special/respected member, they‚Äôve posted no DD and haven‚Äôt shown anything different then the millions of new users who are riding the GME train. 


These accusations would mean billion dollar hedge funds who can literally manipulate the market are sending messages to random, inexperienced users to post ‚Äúbearish DD‚Äù. They‚Äôre sending this to numerous users, users who are apart of the most passionate movement who‚Äôs drive is to fuck over hedge funds. They send this not knowing that the first thing these users would do is to screencap and post it in the sub with disastrous outcomes for them. As happened. A screencap which would show the world that they‚Äôre scared and are resorting to illegal methods. A screencap which could legally ruin them and would reignite the buying and holding of GME as users would think they‚Äôre winning and somethings coming. It‚Äôd destroy them if it got out yet they send it to random users of a fiercely loyal group. 


All this for random inexperienced users who have never done DD, to post convincing bearish DD. Every sub apart from this is posting negative GME comments and stating that it‚Äôs over. Why would these hedge funds need some other random inexperienced users to start doing that at the possible cost of destruction? 


The reward:

Useless negative DD done by users who have never done DD commenting it on a sub and automatically downvoted if it‚Äôs here, or joining the thousands of other users posting bearish GME and negative comments on other subs.


The negatives

Users who are apart of a group with the goal to fuck you over and one of these random users obviously telling the others about the manipulation of the ages. The monumental consequences would far outweigh the little money. 
Revealing to the world that the big guys are scared, thus making the community buy/hold further fucking you over.
Legally getting fucked for bribery and manipulation. 
Reviving the movement and possible media attention that you‚Äôre doing illegal dead‚Äôs.


It‚Äôs either this, or someone‚Äôs made a fake account and is sending trolling messages. One takes 5 minutes by a nobody the other takes the most illogical, useless, counter intuitive fuck up by billionaire hedge funds.

How you can do your part to stop the shill accounts from manipulating the internet.,"As I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all aware, shill accounts are popping up all over /r/WallStreetBets, /r/WallStreetBetsNew and /r/GME with the aim of fostering negative sentiment about GME. They‚Äôre even going so far as to offer bribes to redditors if they post their GME losses. 

Don‚Äôt just sit back in anger and watch this happen. You can actually do something small but significant about it. Here‚Äôs how:

If you encounter an account that you‚Äôre sure is a shill account (verify please, we don‚Äôt want to discredit people with legitimate concerns, just those who attempt to manipulate), simply save their username and check their account every time you log onto Reddit. If you check and see new content posted by the account, comment a disclaimer such as the one I‚Äôm using below:

‚ÄúHey everyone, just a notification that this account is a shill account meant to manipulate and bribe the internet away from GME. Check the account for verification. 

**Also ask yourself, why do they need to employ these tactics? They wouldn‚Äôt if they weren‚Äôt afraid and on the defensive.**

I‚Äôll be keeping track this account daily and commenting this on all of their content as I see it.‚Äù

Keep that comment and their username copied so you can simply paste them each time you need to. This way it can be a quick and simple way of fighting back by increasing awareness.

This creates a massive problem when you combine high short interest, institutional ownership and the need to call in your shares in order to ensure you can vote.

Honest Question: Are we sure we aren't being played?,"As a former poker player, I've become somewhat of an overthinker when it comes to playing strategic games. I've learned to ask myself two important questions when dealing with a game such as poker, which seems to have a lot in common with dealing with stocks:

1) What players are aware of the game they are playing?
2) At what ""level"" are they playing?

You see when you're playing poker, first thing to figure out is, who knows the real game they are playing, and who are the fish. The fish usually play the cards, where as the pro's play the players.

Second point is, once you know someone at your table is playing the real game, you have to ""place them on the map"", as to how advanced this player is. Do they realize you know the game? Do they realize you know they know the game? Do they realize you know that they know that... well, you get the idea. It's no longer a game of poker, it's a game of turtles all the way down and you have to figure out where the other guy things the turtles end, because you're playing the level below that. Meta all the way baby.

Now it's clear that I'm the fish at this table, and that's fine. I'm in it for the history making and will hold my 10 @ 140 without a worry. But I'm wondering if maybe ""we"" aren't being a little ""too straight"" about what's going on here. I'm not looking at the long game, Ryan is going to fix this regardless, but I mean with the short game.

There is two ""alarm bells"" that go off in my head, that I would like more experienced investors to think about and let me/us know at what level this thing is being played.

First alarm went off when some guy posted this ""I work inside a hedge fund"" post a week ago or so, where he was saying the big dogs were getting bonuses payed out early just to get into the GME short-squeeze thing. That post seemed just a little ""too perfect"" for me. Like having a pocket pair and ""trapping"" the other guy with it, and he's just happy calling you no matter what you put in the pot. It's like, it's a done deal and look at these Melvin guys just being setup to be taken down - when at the same time they've been in the game for a long time.
The fact that this post was later mentioned by some dude as ""being sent to me as a PM"", only made that alarm bell go off even more. Why is someone pushing that narrative, when it runs counter to what ""should be pushed"", namely that GME is a lost cause?

Second thing is all the posts about some of us being offered money to talk badly about GME. This seems like a ""dumb"" thing to do, as it has been shown the community is strong (like apes and all those icons I have no clue how to post), and just a matter of time before that would be ousted. It's like ""the evil hedge funds"" are just super simplistic and that bothers me, because they've been able to make a fuck ton of money in the last decades, and gotten away with a lot of fuckery...

So I wonder, are we sure we aren't being played? To me, in a strategic game, it isn't about the move you make, but about how PREDICTABLE you are. It's not about going left or right, but about what your opponent thinks, knows, or thinks he knows. That's what you play with.

If we hold, until the end of times, and everybody knows this. Aren't we still the fish at the table? Aren't there any strategies that could be employed, by evil men, to make money, when they KNOW we will not sell? Isn't it likely that they, or SOMEBODY, is trying to now push the OTHER narrative? The one where we get confirmed in our bias that holding will lead us to salvation (and sooner that Ryan will take us there)?

$GME - A Catalyst and Strategy - GME Day (2021-02-17),"**Original Link** [**here.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/ljazg6/gme_a_catalyst_and_strategy_gme_day_20210217/) 

I see a lot of fantastic DD and analysis being done in the various subs. If you don't know what is going on, there is a great timeline [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lj1vw8/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/) This is top level stuff and the essence of grass roots organizing and strategy. I have been looking through the posts to see if anyone has a plan on how to tackle this pause in making $GME pop. I have seen the various tactics offered and believe we do need to utilize multiple strategies **but** it also needs a catalyst which hasn't been seen yet to accelerate the squeeze. I will go through the current strategies I've read so far and propose the catalyst.

**1 - Ask a Whale for Help - Institutional Investors (Financial)**

This is not a strategy but begging by those paper hands who think this is over or are impatient/scared/FUD. There are bigger players who are invested already which can be seen in the 13G filings. [https://fintel.io/so/us/gme](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) These investors keep coming in and are purchasing large amounts of shares in the millions as recently as yesterday Feb 12th. They are not here to help us but see the same opportunity we do. This may also explain the bullish activity on Feb 10th and 12th as well as huge buy orders in the order list.

**2 - Contact Your Congressman (Political)**

This will need to be done for those who live in the U.S. There are a lot of investors like myself who don't live in the states so we need to rely on those folks who do live in the U.S. to speak for us as well. Don't just email them, explain what you want investigated. Use this [great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lj1u8e/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/) for guidance as it covers where the issues are.

Big government has always sided with big money. I have not seen one example where this isn't the case. I believe the trial will be political theater and will be like other hearings where ""mean"" words are said to make the news highlights but ultimately, we don't see appropriate results. The little guy gets left holding the bag and the big guys get a slap on the wrist. **If there is enough public push to your elected officials, they will at least change the story so that Reddit and DFV are not the fall guys which is what is needed to change to political narrative and flip the story to who is responsible!**

**3 - Make Some Noise (Cultural)**

Hit other social platforms, keep people updated on what's going on and let them understand that this isn't a one time punch to Melvin/Point72 but it's still a battle and it's still going. There's a saying that **culture eats strategy for breakfast.** This is true and I've learned this the hard way many times. The culture drives the attitudes, minds and general sentiment in any of our feelings/thoughts towards a subject. Look up 5th generation warfare and you will see that this is all about culture, technology, and perceptions.

This noise will also create more articles in the news cycle that will show a different sentiment **in our favor** to the public majority who don't know what's going on. These big news outlets have already picked a side and have been trying to fabricate false news stories but as this goes on, we are seeing more articles on smaller platforms exposing what is happening on Wallstreet. I posted on one such article [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lhnp6c/wow_insider_news_about_rigging_against_retail/)

**4 - BUY THE DIPS (Tactical)**

Yes this is a strategy... if you're a day trader trying to recoup your average purchase costs to reduce your average cost of ownership. I know this is also done in the long term as well but I'm trying to make a point. This will help close the gap in available shares but we also know there is some fuckery going on behind the scenes to slowly make gains through a variety of bullshit [tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lj1u8e/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/) and recoup the costs and game the system.

**5 - SUE THEM (Legal)**

There are some class action [lawsuits](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html) which have been started up but I see two issues with this. It is focused on RobinHood which I'm almost certain is being set up as the patsy and if the legal case is won, means pennies on the dollars invested by retailers as well as lost dollars from the opportunity of a squeeze. This is just diamond dust when we wanted diamond hands.

**6 - MOVING PLATFORMS (Technology)**

A lot of people have moved off of RobinHood or changed their margin accounts to cash accounts. This is a good thing. For those who were on platforms which were restricted at any time during the squeeze, what do you think will happen if/when the squeeze occurs, I can bet that those same apps will prevent you from buying or selling when you need to. This sub has had many posts about people having issues with these platforms and this problem will not be solved due to the nature of who funds those businesses. You're the product, not the customer.

My suggestion is to move to a brokerage account. You go to your bank and request one, it takes 2-5 days on average. There is a fee per trade but let's be honest, you get what you pay for. While everyone complained of issues with buying or selling or having a margin account, my brokerage account had no issues whatsoever.

**7 - HOLD, but only if you want... and figure out your exit strategy (Strategic Entry and Exit)**

Some have sold. Some people are holding because they like the stonk. Some are people that want to be part of the movement. But I think we all want to make big gains and do it smartly and come out with diamond hands. Know what your exit point is because all those institutional investors have their exit plan and will make those $$ and then sell. Did you want to sell none or some or choose to exit at 2x, 5x, 10x??? I can't tell you what the stock will go to in the long run but at least think about it and make a plan and stick to it.

**Providing the Catalyst - GME Day**

What I propose is **only for those who are** **still planning to buy**. Do not buy if you can't afford to\*\*.\*\* I'm not asking for anyone to buy who is not planning on buying or can't afford to. If you are already tapped out, you've done your part and no one should judge you. If you sold, it's your $$ and no one should judge. This is only for those people who are still buying or planning on buying.

I'm looking at **Feb 17th, 2021 (2021-02-17) as $GME Day**. This would be a play for a $GME push. If you are planning on buying, why not do it the way the big guys do, pick a price and put in a limit buy order. This will hold the price at a certain spot and as the price goes up, move your limit buy up. If a bunch of people keep doing this, not only are you getting the stock that you planned on buying anyways but are setting new resistance points and focusing the volume to a single day. Volume was the biggest reason the squeeze wasn't squoze and if you're on RobinHood or some other apps that will limit your buying, I expect the same to happen when you go in to squeeze.

Why this day?

* It needs to be far enough out to get enough folks aware of this strategy as well as make noise about the setup.
* Do it before the congress hearing on Feb 18th to create some buzz and help positive sentiment for DFV.
* For those who are still moving platforms, it's enough time to get them setup.
* There are long call options and some interesting call options at $200 and up I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lgyyot/gme_good_info_and_possibly_good_news/) which expire on the 19th showing some promise for a nice setup.
* But... I'm open to selecting a different day.

**Who am I?**

Let me tell you a little bit about me. I'm a strategic business advisor but not in finance or stocks. The point of my job is to look at future indicators and figure out what my organizations next move is and also how to move the company internally in that direction and a plan on how to influence industry and government. It's one of those jobs of knowing the industry/politics/culture/trends as well as trying to figure out hype from reality and if someone is selling to me vs providing an opportunity.

I'm not an expert in any field but a generalist and have to be a bit of a jack of all trades. I'm also old enough to have developed a pretty decent bullshit detector. And let me tell you, there are a lot of bullshit articles and statements in Reddit and in mainstream media.

I also do have a modest amount of $GME and $AMC. I didn't include $AMC in this tactic as we have to be focused on the one and then can move to the other. I also believe $AMC is in a much better position due to the number of shares owned by retailers and the general direction towards it moving on its own.

I'm not a financial advisor but I am providing my opinion on a strategic path to avoid being a bagholder. Feel free to criticize and challenge.

Was WSB always just about making money and being a douche?,"I was late to the game to the Wallstreetbets sub (not linking, y'all know which one it is, they don't deserve extra traffic).  I didn't even hear about GME or WSB until the original squeeze actually happened.  Didn't even buy in until the Monday after, inspired by all the positivity going on there.  It really felt like a cool moment for me.  Something worth spending my money on.

Come to find out that WSB, apparently, has always just been about making money and being a douche?  That's pretty much the message going on there now.

Tell ya what: that ain't why I joined.

I do believe that, apart from douchebags, there's some shilling and shady shit going on there.  But I'm no conspiracy guy.  I think it's pretty much impossible for us to know how much has actually been a coordinated effort to spread FUD about GME, and how much is just people being dicks.  I believe there's both going on.  What I do know is that ""how to buy a Reddit account"" started trending on Google right when GME started mooning.  

Some people claimed that ""those could be accounts to pump GME back up so retailers who bought at the top can sell at a reasonable price"".  Not really buying that.  Hasn't really worked, has it?  The theory of those accounts being used to spread FUD about GME seems much more plausible.  Couple that with all the bullshit going on with the ""silver squeeze"".  I'm not sure about the pot thing, trust some other ape.  But the silver squeeze at the height of the original GME squeeze was just blatant manipulation. 

But I digress: I truly believe that, apart from the unknown percentage of shillers and Melvin bots, that there is a core of WSB who is truly just about making money and being a douche.  

Fuck that.

Look, WSB can cash in on their stupid movie deal or 5 minutes of fame or whatever.  Go to town!  And feel free to shit on all the new members joining in.  But just know, *those new members are the whole fucking reason your sub is in the limelight in the first place.*  I don't believe this would have been as successful or noteworthy if the newbs among us hadn't have jumped in and gave it real upward momentum.  You fucking owe your fame to us, dicks.  So when you're ready to crawl back into your miserable life of making money and being a cunt, just remember that you couldn't have done what you did without us.  

WSB will slowly fade away into the dark annals of history, but what happened with GME will not.  What happened, and IS happening with GME, will persist.  

I don't care about WSB.  I don't care about Reddit. These things are just platforms.  

What I care about is the movement.

Look, I don't think anyone should YOLO their life savings to ""stick it to the hedge funds, man!""  But if you wanna spend some extra cash on a YOLO gamble, then by all means!  I, for one, am really enjoying it!  But I also only spent what I could afford to lose.

And yeah, guess what, this **does** mean something to me.  I do give a fuck.

""Don't invest emotionally"", etc.  Yeah. Good financial advice.  I'm not here to give financial advice.  I'm here to give life advice.  And things do fucking matter.  The world is really ugly sometimes.  We can make a difference.

So that's all.  Be not discouraged by the state of WSB or their fuckery.  We are a part of something greater here.  That's what they don't get.  They're only out for themselves.  But us?  We're tuned into something big.  And IDK, that's kinda cool man.

Nobody go YOLOing their money into GME because of what I just said. But if you're buying and holding what you can afford to lose, and you believe in it...

Positive mindset apes ü¶ç,"Just a reminder not to feel down when seeing red on GameStop price, it‚Äôs not a loss if you don‚Äôt sell.

I have around 2k in GME (56 average) and it was  money that was sitting there for a gamble so I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was all lost.

I‚Äôve learned more these last weeks than I have in a year of trading, even the money I am currently down is completely worth it, it‚Äôs a price I‚Äôd pay for what I‚Äôve learned, if it wasn‚Äôt for GME right now I‚Äôd probably be jumping on these shitty weed stocks being pumped right now hoping for a quick buck.

Think of it like paying for a crash course in how corrupt the whole US financial system is, the entire media is now completely focused on covering this up so the working class won‚Äôt benefit. Even if we dont get our squeeze this has all been worth it to see them sweat.

Not planning on selling my shares at the moment but if I do it‚Äôll be only to cover initial investment around when it hits 1k per share.

Also made me have a whole new outlook on how I want to progress and where to put my money, I don‚Äôt trust the stock market at all anymore knowing that my stocks investments could one day be manipulated to benefit some multi billion dollar hedge fund in front of the whole world and nothing could be done about it.

The state of GME and WSB (DD),"Edit posted yesterday and today but didn‚Äôt really stick, but feel like this is definitely worth reading 


The state of WSB

I have been noticing something was up a week ago after the attempted mod coup. The community hasn‚Äôt felt right since then and the influx of shills,bots, and new retards has lowered the IQ more than I thought possible. I used to trust at least 80% of people were being honest about positions and such a month ago, now I feel it‚Äôs maybe 30% or less. I truly realized the extent when all the GME DD was deleted at market open. 

I will give an example of how good bots are at shifting narratives. Remember when we had the a massive influx after the Elon tweet(that might be what caused the community to hit critical mass) when that happened people were solely pushing GME. Soon after that however bots began pushing AMC(bankruptcy thesis still intact at the time) NOK(I don‚Äôt even know) and BB(ehh decent), all of these were pushed by bots because initially only bots would push these. With all the new members who barely know how to work their email saw this, they bought in. That massive increase in volume convinced others to FOMO in. They used the unwitting to shift sentiment and pump something hard enough now they are seen as legit, even though there was no DD posted except BB ever and AMC was banned from being posted when it felt the initial pump. 

Now ask your self if anything important happened last night that would need to be buried?Hmm ? Oh maybe the SI report showing 78%. An there is claims ( I haven‚Äôt looked into) that say that the formula was changed now they are using shares short/(shares outstanding +synthetic longs) instead of shares short/ shares outstanding. This change is important because it‚Äôs makes the number seem far smaller. I heard on a thread I can‚Äôt find anymore that it puts true short interest at high as 120%-150% about where we were at the very start of this. This is a massive bull case. The short squeeze hasn‚Äôt ended yet and there are just as many shorts who can still be squeezed. 

When I logged on to WSB there was tons of quality GME DD but it was all taken down at market open, I know because I went back to go read them, but they were gone. Most were removed under rule 2. What I did see though was Weed gains and spam about what to buy. Weed is being pushed heavy by bots and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if HF helped some of those inital gains to cause FOMO then sell as the price increases. This weed was not organic, but now so many retards have FOMO into it there will be some real gains out there. So if some one logged into WSB they would see straight weed and no GME this prevents anyone who doesn‚Äôt click on the GME from seeing any positive news. 


Are mods corrupt? I believe a vast majority of mods are good and not corrupted. I think they have been pushed to remove GME to remove spam from the subreddit. Who ever convinced them too was the bad actor they could merely have been manipulated. Although ZJZ the mod who pointed out corruption, was banned for 6 months by Reddit for pointing out the corruption. There are also new mods that others are unfamiliar with that could influence a lot behind the scenes [mods ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WSBAfterHours/comments/lec5y7/make_your_own_assumptions_but_someone_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) . I think the mods have been infiltrated in some form and a few are trying to suppress GME. There are likely a majority who still want what‚Äôs best for the community though. 

Also GME holders have been described as cultish and this is true. We have been censored, lied too and can‚Äôt trust anyone. This is pretty typical to a cult and it stems from the fact that they are desperate and doing everything to make us doubt. If they let our post stay up and didn‚Äôt mass remove GME then I guarantee we would be perceived as far less cultish and wouldn‚Äôt start thinking everyone would lie to us. They are also deleting quality add to replace it with shitty DD that makes all of us seem more crazy and preventing people from joining us. 




The state of GME

Why is GME still bullish 
1. Short interest 
2. Shills + bots 
3. Fundamentals 
4. An enormous amount of float is controlled by Diamond hands 
5. FOMO


1. Right now as I discussed above short interest is still very high and extremely bullish for the stock. It‚Äôs also likely increased an absurd amount since 1/29 because they forced us down from our all time high with more naked shorting. I expect the next report to be far higher short interest than right now. Although many of the new shorts got in at very good prices and will be far harder to squeeze than Melvin was at 4$. The HF that shorted at 300+ likely rode the rocket up and shorted us down. There are also many other shorts who doubled down and made their position more comfortable as well. 

2. Shills and bots are still out in force. This makes me feel better because it means they are still desperate. If they all stopped posting then I would be worried that they actually won. Shills and bots are also trying to distract us with weed gains like above. 

3. I‚Äôm not selling at this point because I feel like fundamentally the company is still deeply undervalued. Also everyone who think it‚Äôs over valued remember Cohen built a dog food company capable of beating Amazon. With the name recognition of GME and free advertising expect this stock to have a lot more new customers and returning customers. There are plenty of good DD on Fundamentals still out there if you look. Also management still hasn‚Äôt offered 100 million in shares yet so they still think it‚Äôs going higher than 450 

4. Diamond handed  have bought and control an enormous amount of float right now. So many of us have held at 450$ there is no way we are selling before that. In addition to that there is low volume and almost no float left. They keep dropping the price to buy back cheaper but that means nothing when retail is selling a hundred shares at a time when they have to cover millions. 

5. FOMO, when this thing takes off people will FOMO in again trying to take the rocket to space. Once we get positive momentum again this thing could take off especially with options up too 800$ a legendary gamma squeeze could occur. Once tons more retards start buying in we will achieve lift off.

One thing to remember is we still need a catalyst of some form to see this take off. There is a possibility earnings might be the closest catalyst. The point is we will probably bounce around this price range for a while and experience high intraday volatility but little long lasting price moves.

Any ideas of how we can PROVE manipulation?,"Greetings fellow apes,

OK, we know HFs are trying to screw us in any and every way possible. I've heard many good theories on how they are driving down GME. e.g. short attacks, cross-trading, lying to government agencies, media manipulation/FUD campaigns, etc. Additionally, we really should break down the complex array of actors that may be involved--HFs themselves, Broker-Dealers, the DTCC, etc.

Given how invested (emotionally and monetarily) we are with the whole GME situation right now, I propose we try some more solid research. It's time to put our ape brains together.

Let's list out our theories and investigate whether we can actually prove them. Personally, I would like to focus on actual stock manipulations that we can report to the SEC/Congress/public at large. If anyone else wants to focus on media/FUD, go for it (in my opinion the rampant FUD campaign is obvious but not necessarily illegal). So please list your ideas below and/or DM me to help organize our thoughts.

Naked Shorts and Laddering Down GME,"Diamond handed ape here, It's obvious the HFs are manipulating the stock down to about 50 a share every day like clockwork. Are they covering their shorts without the squeeze? Can they honestly get out of this by slowly covering without spiking the price like we want?

ü§≤üíéü§≤ WHY I'M GOING TO HOLD GME ü§≤üíéü§≤,"Is this the biggest cover up going on in the history of Wall Street? 

Finra reports 78% Short Interest on GME but there is a huge problem. Data suggests that over 147% of short interest were covered while people were buying more and more GME. Platforms are reporting there is over 80-90% buying happening with GME. Where did they find millions of share to cover? Volume from last 3 days were 62m, 25m, and 26m. Price has fallen significantly during low volume days, however there were huge volumes on the days that price jumped. 

Most important question here is:
Why did they pay $300+ to purchase shares on a day that SP trading at $59? If there were enough shares, if they have really dropped the short volume then they should've found shares at few $ more than the trading price NOT $300/share to buy back. 

Also don't forget that in the past reports were falsified, because reporting a huge short interest will spark interest and get the rally going soon. Always remember Wall Street share trading is a RIGGED game. Jim Cramer said you tell the public the opposite thing to the fact to stop the market from moving.  

If they can naked short a stock more the float, if they can get all trading platforms to shut down, if they falsified the reports in the past, if the whole thing is rigged WHY WOULD I  TRUST THE REPORT THAT COMES FROM ONE OF THEM? They will only get few millions in fines comparing to losing billions in short position. So the cost effective method is lie on the report. 78% short interest a whole lot of bananas to buy back anyway. 

I decided to HOLD, the squeeze hasn't happened based on my research. Also keep in mind that institutional buyers like BlackRock are loading this , and currently institutional ownership sits above 200%. Why? They know what this worth in days, weeks, month and years.

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,"TLDR: Hard to distill it into TLDR but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in GME (and there is strong evidence to support that theory). I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling**.‚Äù

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance"" and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù** Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äú**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman‚Äôs words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‚Äò**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price‚Äô**‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚Äú**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Edit: Someone asked ""so what‚Äôs the current short position? Looks like they some how covered?""

Pasting my response below because I'd like people to see:

I've heard people say 78%, thats still a high number, but personally I made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position. Apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrist/a small fine. I also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with, more on that on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/).

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3,"Reposting because for whatever reason once this post started gaining traction in r/stocks it was removed.

**r/stocks reactivated the post, I posted this in several places please comment there as it has the most opinions to go around and I‚Äôm not jumping all over the place**

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say ""it"" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, ""it"", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including ""synthetic longs"" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a ""what-if"" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many ""what-if's"" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. ""It's two weeks old"". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) ""The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.""

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/05 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes ""just happen"". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), was at the time ""inevitable"" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Mid March-ish), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from ""get over it, the squeeze happened"" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

The next shill play will be trying to control price expectations to make ü¶ç jump off üöÄ as soon as they can,"If this becomes the MOASS as it was always poised to be, apes be entering uncharted waters. The moonshot was always the possibility that GME was shorted beyond available shares for trade so that the apes holding with diamond hands could, theoretically, dictate the price at which their shares are sold.

Like everyone else, I have no idea what that top price may be. In fact, I know nothing about any of this shit so if you listen to me or take anything I say as financial advice you're a real dumb fuck. I offer no advice, financial or otherwise. However, I have seen others guesstimate that if the HFs holding shorts have to liquidate it would result in a fund of billions resulting in share prices of like $20k - $30k... truly mind-boggling numbers that make my pp go üçÜ. In a situation like that, HFs would sell their mother's left nut to buy your stock at $1k, $5k, hell anything is a bargain to cover their shorts at that point.

So even when/if the üöÄ takes off, apes with diamond hands will go to outer space. Paper hand bitches will be letting the HFs off easy.

TL;DR be wary of shills trying to influence what you think is a good/reasonable time to jump off the üöÄ. This may be a truly historic and unprecedented event so that the ceiling is not known and maybe not even seeable from our current terrestrial domain.

‚õî DavidNIO PREDICTS A MARKET CRASH ‚õî,"First of all those who are wondering who the heck is DavidNIO and what did he predict in the past I suggest jump on Google and type DavidNIO. Click the first link, first post and read my list of predictions. I have predict precisely prices , dates etc on my favourite stock NIO.

Now Gamestop has taken my research attention. I'm predicting the following things.

1. Gamestop short squeeze will happen on a magnitude that no body expected. Gamestop is not in a bubble it's a rabbit hole. So share price will only shoot up when they cover their short position using REAL shares not using synthetic shares to manipulate the report. 

2. STOCK MARKWT CRASH - While Gamestop moving to the mars other stocks which are in a bubble territory will why they down. Why? Because when the market needs to pay the debt created by the rabbit hole. So when Gamestop investors ask $XXXX a share,  that money needs to come from somewhere else. I predicted this last week and posted on my twitter and Facebook page.

I'm holding and keeping cash ready to buy more shares If I see a market crash. If you lose GME position then there is no guarantee that you'll be able to buy shares back as they don't have enough shares. That's why they are using synthetic shares. 

Again this prediction is not guaranteed,  however I believe there is a high probability for this to happen. I'm only sharing my view and opinion. So you can prepare yourself for such event.
GME is not in a bubble,  it's a rabbit hole. Which is the opposite to a bubble. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Institutional investors have increased their positions in GME to 200+% .

"I'm going to ELY5 the situation we're in, from a logic and psychology perspective. SI is likely through the roof and the squeeze is likely to happen very soon.","***Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I do not recommend any position here. Everything here is speculation and my personal opinion and not to be construed as factual in any way. I may not be correct on some of my numbers. Do your own research before making a play.***

&amp;#x200B;

There will be no TL;DR. If you can't read this, you're too dumb to sell anyways so this isn't for you.   


There is a pattern of behavior that we see in GME that can help us predict when we can expect to see the squeeze happen. Huge shoutout to DookieDimez on Twitch for bringing this to light. Check out this video if you are really curious [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPenJRN4QM4&amp;t=6809s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPenJRN4QM4&amp;t=6809s)  


Anyways, there has been a pattern of behavior in GME price that is centered around the settlement date. What happens is the first week after the settlement, the price goes down, and then starts to go up as the settlement date approaches. This is an obvious strategy, because they want to report the best possible numbers to hide their position as best they can.  


Keep in mind this is not an exact, perfect science. However, if we try to understand how a short might want to navigate their massive position from a strategy perspective, we can discern that they want to 1) attack the price with shorting the first week, to try and help cover and 2) slowly cover in the 2nd week so you don't report a high SI. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to go too far back for sake of berevity, but I encourage you all to watch the video above and look at it yourself. Looking at January 15th, we see that the first week was red, and the 2nd week massively green. This has a lot to do with buying pressure, but it is also very likely that shorts were covering as well. This is when GME went from $20 to $40 in 2 days (Jan 13th and 14th).  


The next reporting date was none other than January 29th. This time, however, the price got away from them early on  and the price started going crazy. Imagine how fucked these guys realized they were at this point. Let's take a look at January 26th-27th  


At about 12:00 on the 26th, it appears that a big player entered the fray and forced the price to close around $150, and if you're a short you are probably starting to shit your pants. Next day we pop to $300+ and the volume halves, there is a vicious fight for control and the shorts are losing the fight.  


Next day, we started going parabolic right at the opening bell. Of course we all know what happened next.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what would your strategy be if you were in their shoes? You have only two objectives: keep the price down enough to avoid a margin call, and make sure you cover as many shorts as you can for the January 29th reporting date.  


Above 400 is where we started to see huge market sell-offs, it's pretty obvious that they had to close large positions to remain solvent. The 28th and 29th, they defended the $400 price hard. Both the 28th and 29th saw HUGE swings low before the price settled at exactly $325 on Friday.  


From a risk management perspective, you would want to balance keeping the price at a comfortable level with covering as many shorts as you can in order to report the lowest number possible. 325 seems like a reasonable price to satisfy those requirements, albeit they are still obviously fucked but have to play with the hand they're dealt.  


At this point, there is \~78% SI on GME, as reported today.  


So that brings us to this week. I implore you to go look at the chart.  


It's blood red, ponded to $50. Some may believe it was people running for the hills. But I believe this was due to a MASSIVE amount of shorting against a restricted demand. It doesn't get any more ""last ditch effort"" than this.  


The shorts know their positions since Jan 29th, we didn't know until today. So what does this mean?  


It means that they know we know, which changes the game and gives them two options:  


1) Continue to dig yourself into a hole by continually shorting, hoping people that haven't sold thus far sell despite not selling at sub-50 prices.  
2) Start covering  


I think it is possible that they do #1, but if they do that then the next FINRA report will be nuts. There is no way in my mind that they are currently less than 100% shorted. Ultimately, we will see but the price action and volume tell a story of massive amounts of shorts entering the market.  


Liquidity is bone dry fellas. That's why we see those huge blips AH. As soon as the shorts relent, this thing will skyrocket.  


I predict that the rest of this week is going to be *huge*. They will be in the same conundrum they were the week before the 29th: needing to show the lowest SI as they can on the February 12th settlement date.  


If we don't pop this week and they continue to suppress the price, we will know the nature of their short position on February 24th and that may be the day of reckoning.  


At some point, they have to cover. The longer they wait, the more it will cost. Their time is coming to an end- and fast.

My understanding is that they've actually been buying up any shares that become available outside of public view, off the exchange, covering their shorts without impacting the share price, then selling on the exchange to tank the price. If that's the case, that's so incredibly evil. So many lives are being financially ruined from this as people panic that their investment is failing and sell, and each time the HF buy off the exchange and cover their shorts?

Maybe I'm missing some information here.

"it's always darkest, just before the dawn","Here's some good ol' original DD I wrote myself. Let's get right into it.


### Quick Mafs ###
__PROOF that there's more short interest than whatever BS^3 formulas and equations are calculating.__ Look @ daily volume and see 4 yourself. MMs are stealing your shares, keep locking in losses.  

Firstly, let‚Äôs do some math. Now, you bears out there will say it doesn‚Äôt matter, that it‚Äôs all sentiment, but we‚Äôre playing a numbers game so why not check them out? Peep the daily short volume. ‚Äî let‚Äôs check 2/8/2021 and Today.  

 
+ Total Short Volume = 11,348,581 (Finra)  
+ Total Volume 2/8/2021 = 25,687,282 (TDA)  
+ Total Volume 2/9/2021 = 26,843,082 (TDA)  
+ Average Volume ((2/8-2/9) / 2) = 26,265,182  
 
These are the publicly traded SHARES. Short interest sits at ~half of the entire volume for these days. Now the interesting part is that these numbers never include the options market move, nor do they include dark pool trades (hidden trades, for example sweeps using IBKR) 
 
Thankfully, we have access to both of these. Today 2/9:  
 
+ put options traded 279,491 (TDA)  
+ call options traded 151,725 (TDA)  
+ difference = 127,766  
+ shares = (#of contracts \* 100)  
+ shares = 12,766,600  
 

Total Short Volume + Options Implied Move  

+ 12,766,600 + 11,348,581 = 24,125,181

See that Avg. Total Volume above? Subtract the resulting short volume and we get: 
 
+ 26,265,182 - 24,125,181 = 2,140,001  
 
*~2 million shares sold from paper hands and bought by hedge funds.* That‚Äôs roughly 0.079% of total daily volume. **Shorts still open confirmed.** Hedgies only closed 0.079% of their short position so far. Still 99.921% shares held short. Nerds, extrapolate this to the official fake news report that came out today.

### Got Any Vaseline? ###
Remember Fidelity counting shares? Looks like they‚Äôve lost a few. That share count emergency shareholder meeting would be nice. These MMs are trading 100% of the float. Shares that they don‚Äôt even own, to synthetically drive the price down and steal the real shares. If a clown like me can do this math, so can hedge funds - probably - and they sure as hell are still accumulating as many shares as possible.  


The charade will last til retail is kil, is my guess, since both shorts and longs h8 retail taking their $. Looks pretty hopeless, retailers giving up, the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù is supposedly ‚Äúended‚Äù and media is playing along trying to get retail focused on *literally anything else* before they realize what‚Äôs happening.

### Onions 4 Your Eyes ###

A 100% squeeze? It's never happened before, maybe the closest would be the time when 2 farmers bought all the onions on the agriculture market 100m years ago and proceeded to short it. (see: Onion Futures Act) But even then, onions never got squeezed, they just rotted. This is different, it has the potential to actually erupt into a shitnado, *shares can't fucking rot like onions.* I can imagine why both long and short hedgies would want to keep things relatively quiet. Secretly, though, ***they're fighting for those shares with everything they've got***. Even the beginning of a full squeeze and shares would be valued at sellers price. Back door deals between hedge funds for _a hell of a lot more than $50 a share._ They've been caught already trading shares they don't own, they either pay^up or get taken out of the game permanently.


### Who is kil tho? ###

Not just Melvin shorted, any other short hedge funds (quite a few according to finra) would be at immediate risk of liquidation if they aren't buying shares at a higher price than another competing hedge fund. It's why the fractional share (market buys) were sold and bought at very high prices during the Elon spike last week and is the reason for the after/pre-market trading screenshots you mother-lovers are posting. It's literally either buy shares first (at a higher price than the competitors) or the hedge fund goes bankrupt. *But no one's fucking selling.* 2m shares sold today, its literally 0.07% of what they need.  


### 4get Anything? ###
Not to mention, previous short % was 227%?  
Not to mention, they're under a time crunch because stonks only go up?  
Not to mention the shares can be recalled anytime?  
Did I mention the S(E)^C is watching?  hi  
Maybe I forgot to mention the daily short interest rate is tens of million$ per day?  


### FDs &amp; FTDs ###
Fuck is a $SLV? This shit is beyond that, and guess what? Biden's SEC pick, Gary Gensler, is the same guy who rooted out wall street fraud multiple times, leading to fine$ ***with a B*** back in 2008 BT, oh yeah, how?... you guessed it... FTDs.   


Maybe I should've mentioned those __Failure To Deliver notices__ - it means the clearing houses are receiving *IOUs* on shares from the brokers, and the clearing houses are putting *IOUs* on the backlog (read: throwing into the trashcan) while fabricating shares to replace the IOUs. A great idea, until those IOUs keep piling up and you've now lent out an equal number of shares to a new party - who‚Äîand get this because it's important‚Äîa new party who's ALSO shorting the shares‚Äîand adding to the cycle of FTDs and IOUs.  


Welp, they'll jump or live in concrete paradises before I sell these bad boys for a loss. I'll wait, you should wait, everyone should wait. First time in financial history that we (the call side, the bulls, wsb diamond hand geniuses like you and I) have the luxury of time on our sides. Meanwhile, *tick* ‚Äî the shorts are running out *tock.*


The spike on the Jan 29 EOD was them covering or synthetically flattening‚Äîlowering their position's delta by offsetting with options‚Äîtheir short positions. The numbers as of close on Jan 29 are what's been posted, and we can now hypothesize that the shorts flattened with the knowledge that these numbers would be posted using that date. It went from a low of $250 that day to $325 @ close.

 
Now they're back in the shorts, pretty much confirmed by the daily short volume (Finra) - and the next report depends on whether they cover (actually, or synthetically) by February 12. We'll be looking to see them cover again on this Friday, if they're interested in keeping up the charade.  


tl;dr ‚Äî The data isn't rigged, it's just old and useless at this point. They've just added to their short position. The numbers released to sheep are simply for show-and-tell. Take a bite from the media &amp; tell me more about how it's going to $3.

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There‚Äôs an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out‚Ä¶ Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further ‚Äúbreaking the squeeze.‚Äù

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can¬†[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***‚ÄúTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****‚Äù**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks¬†‚Äúhelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because the shares were never properly located‚Äù. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry‚Äôs (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren‚Äôt really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to ‚Äúcover‚Äù short positions they shouldn‚Äôt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

If this is true, and as explained earlier there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes
""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned arguments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this train of logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during the time that shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall in the past week. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of calls at 
800 dollars to expire in March. In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must factor in the possibility that shorts might no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case?

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/)**

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at [https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)**

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can be ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from another perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.) 

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation or Short Ladder Attacks which are and potentially other methods (there's arguments on whether Short Ladder Attacks really exist and I won't get into it here but I encourage you to do your own research)
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some of those who held, who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility or reality of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

"Ever notice how the ""SELL SELL SELL""-crowd never do the caveat of not being financial advisors?","Like, why do they feel so comfortable giving out financial advice in that direction? No eating crayons, no retardation, no nothing. I'll just confess, I have no idea what's going on anymore, I can go from moon-certainty to dirt-certainty quicker that I like, and quicker than I'd imagined. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both buy and sell side seems to have gone industrial-strength, and I can't even make sense of what the bots want me to do anymore. I can imagine an article in wikipedia in 10 years about this that says regular people were fucked over by big money, but I can also picture desperate hf-people begging for credit right now, and a domino-effect of people having to tell their boss they fucked up (prefer and delight in the latter).

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be holding. I'm pinning a bit of hope to [wherearetheshares.com](https://wherearetheshares.com), at least I can follow the argument every step of the way there,  it makes sense to me. Maybe there's a squeeze, maybe there isn't, but I think the company is golden either way. It will have an ape army on its side, and as the MSM is losing credibility by the day, the article about this on wikipedia will be written by apes, and that will stand. With the support of the apes, GME can move into almost any e-based market it wants, with strong grassroot support. Apes on the supply side and apes on the demand side. 

&amp;#x200B;

We collectively own a significant piece of a billion-dollar company now, if we could coordinate just a bit, we'd all be rich this year (and we could make GME buy reddit and get people who knows what reddit is supposed to be to run it). That seems like a tough ask, though, so maybe not this year, but the stock. Is. Good.

For those who say there is no ‚Äúmovement‚Äù or ‚Äú revolution‚Äù behind GME. Hear me out because it‚Äôs the individual options traders (WSB retards) who will end up suffering the most.,"‚ÄúThe stock market as a whole has become a derivative of the options market.‚Äù    -some guy

My tiny brain heard from some kid in my special ed class that the people who shorted got enough ‚Äúcash infusions‚Äù to cover their interest on shorts for a lot longer.  We thought ‚Äúthe war was going to be over by Christmas‚Äù, but they were given a lot more ammo and are dug in harder now.  They probably  re-shorted at the high points and are waiting to cash out.( we will know more tomorrow night) They want the real holders to give up on this.   They want to out last us until we need the rent money we invested when we thought we were going to get a fast gain. By re-shorting it shows what kind of blood thirsty maniacs these people are. They don‚Äôt just want out.  Now that we have fucked with them, they want to teach us a lesson. The initial run up was probably just a retail euphoria run.  They used that to re-short harder.   

The overall fight here isn‚Äôt going to be determined by the little guys, there are big funds/whales on our side who are out for the shorters too.  We have sharpened sticks, while the big players are in a nuclear stand-off. 

We have to take this into a historic fact.   If we (retail and big guys who are with us) hold out and the shorts have to cover, this event would set a precedent.  Not only do the shorts want to put us in our places tilling their fields. If they loose, we prove we are capable of playing in the big leagues and don‚Äôt need anyone to hold our hands(which they charge us to do) If we win we maintain our ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù as individual traders.  Anyone who says this is just about money, there is no ‚Äúmovement‚Äù or ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù here, apparently doesn‚Äôt realize if we fuck this up, they will most likely fuck with the rights of individual traders to play in the options game(where a lot of the WSB tards make good money.). The sentiment is, that these crazy ‚Äúoptions yolos‚Äù throw a huge burden on the overall stability of the market, by causing the options writers to buy shares to cover any exercised options. They have to buy a factor of between 2x and up to 10x+ to make sure the supply is there and hedge against potential failure to delivers. This drives up the price of shares by a similar factor.  The more people that get onboard the more it drives up the price due the them hedging up. Kinda the opposite of what the shorts do. It‚Äôs a chain reaction.  This could have been why Robinhood halted on specific stocks, to prevent failure to delivers. As individuals we can do crazy shit like put all of grandmas inheritance into a crazy call and then let the other bandwagon tards follow us and do the same. The funds have fiduciary responsibilities to not yolo their clients into crazy risk like this.  It‚Äôs either illegal or really stupid for them. Us retail dummies are a risk to their ability to understand/predict the market.  It‚Äôs like when you get more than one ball on a pinball machine.  

Really, I think all we as individuals can do in the GME case is be stubborn more than ever and hold until they give up, and buy more if you can. This could last a long time though. Just do this to be an asshole if that‚Äôs what gets you going. 

Hold on and prepare for a war of attrition.  But never take your eyes off of this.  We are at the whims of the big guys on our side.  If they give up we are going down with them.   

To those big guys who are here with us.  Thank you.

The narrative of WSB has changed but there weren‚Äôt any factors that could‚Äôve changed it. Let‚Äôs think about this new narrative that someone is pushing.,"The factors for the GME play are still stay the same. All of that DD you read in the first place that got you to buy into GME are still relevant. 

Obviously like many others here have stated, WSB has unfortunately been taken over by bots and people who are most likely be getting paid to ruin the sub and change the narrative. 

Positive posts are being taken down and suddenly negative GME is the new meta. 

Maybe more of us would‚Äôve fallen for it if it wasn‚Äôt such an immediate switch. 

On Friday, I spent an unhealthy amount of time on WSB and I can tell you the positivity was there and üíéüôås, ‚ÄúGME to the moon‚Äù, üöÄüöÄüöÄ morale was still very strong as it had been for almost 2 weeks straight. 

Suddenly I wake up Saturday morning and it was like someone flipped a switch. All negativity and a lot of people claiming to be ‚ÄúOG‚Äù WSB yet they‚Äôre harassing GME holders. 

I‚Äôve been apart of WSB since 800k degenerates and no where along the journey has there ever been this kind of hostility towards 1 particular stock and play. 

After checking the comment history on a lot of these infiltrators and even though they may have been apart of Reddit for 3+ years, many of them haven‚Äôt commented in months or years and then suddenly they are now posting 9-10 negative comments per hour FOR 12+ HOURS STRAIGHT. 

Dead. Giveaway. 

This is my speculation, but I really think they‚Äôre real people being paid to ruin WSB. 

Plus top mods being removed and replaced by new unknown people. It‚Äôs a wreck. 

So why do I mention this? 

Well I know many of you would see the price tanking on GME and rely on WSB to lift your spirits, but WSB may not be able to lift your spirits anymore. This is the time where if you‚Äôre really diamond hands you have to stay confident in your position and it‚Äôs a little harder to find confirmation bias. (Although I like this r/GME sub. Lots of smart people here it seems. Come here then) 

Remember that nothing has changed except the price. 

These hedge funds want to scare you. Don‚Äôt let them scare you. They‚Äôre still playing dirty which shows that GME is not over. If it was over none of this would be happening. 



Now, what does the strong WSB infiltration tell us? 

The biggest red flag I see if that it didn‚Äôt happen on Friday, it happened around midnight - 2am on Saturday. Everything was still normal Friday night, but by early Saturday morning it was dominated by negativity. 


So here‚Äôs some questions I came up with that we should ask ourselves and think about the possibilities. 


1. Were they waiting to see what GME‚Äôs price would do Friday? 
Meaning if it went down would they have bothered with this effort? 

2. Are they planning a huge short attack on Monday to try and legitimize this new narrative? 

3. Are they afraid of the short interest being released on Tuesday? 
Meaning if it‚Äôs not manipulated and actually shows a surge in short interest will it be so devastating for them that they need to convince as many as possible to sell on Monday before the data comes out? Making this weekend effort to ruin WSB some kind of Hail Mary? 

4. Why didn‚Äôt this happen last weekend after GME was mooning all week? There was a huge drop this week, shouldn‚Äôt that have been good for them? Why this now?

5. Since it is so obvious that there‚Äôs an agenda to get WSBers to sell, why would you get pushed around and sell from that fear? 

6. Why? Why is there this sudden hostile takeover of WSB whose bashing GME and GME holders trying to create fear and cause a sell off? Someone has a lot to lose?

7. If all of the shorts actually covered why would there be so much obvious manipulation? 

8. Why do they want you to sell so badly that they‚Äôd go to this level?

9. Why hasn‚Äôt there been DD or any reasons stated as to why you should sell? I haven‚Äôt seen any data or any reasoning as to why it‚Äôs over. 



None of this is financial advice nor am I a financial advisor. 

Be ready for a big week. This squeeze could take many weeks to happen. Be ready for the worst this week but let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs going up. Either way I will be diamond hands even if it‚Äôs another huge drop. 

Let me know what you think about the strong WSB infiltration. 

TLDR: Just because WSB is breaking down doesn‚Äôt mean people are selling. You aren‚Äôt alone there‚Äôs many diamond hands out there. Someone is showing their cards by going to these extreme efforts to get us to sell.

Clarification regarding the short squeeze,"So the GME stock was, to say the least, over-shorted. Some observant gamblers have decided to exploit that fact and jumped in on the action. They have also let their fellow degenerates find out about this. So everybody buys GME, the shorters get scared and start covering, the price skyrockets and a lot of people make a lot of money. So is that it? No. Since the data was pointing to the fact that there was still a huge amount of short interest, the natural thing was to assume that if everybody religiously held onto their stocks, we could trigger a short squeeze. Fair enough. But it seems to me, only now after having done some research, that there is something flawed about that reasoning.

Most of what I will reference here was found on this [link](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html).

The reasoning behind the short squeeze is based on the premise that the hedge funds must cover their shorts. But what if it isn't so? What if they don't really have to?

First of all, everybody kinda knows that when this just exploded, the short interest was around 140% or rather, 140% of GameStop's shares were shorted (the fact that they even shorted more shares than there are is rooted in the same problem as this post). But now, that number seems to be declining to about  51.72% of float according to this [site](https://isthesqueezesquoze.com/) while at the same time GME's stock price declined from \~460$ to \~100$ at the time of writing this post. So how is this possible?

Most people seem to attribute the downfall to a shady practice called short ladder attack. While there are certainly reasons to believe this is being done, what if they aren't really covering their shorts at all? Not only that, what if they don't really have to cover them?

The first [site](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) I've referenced goes into details how stocks can be counterfeited, particularly with naked shorts. So when the 3 day rule expires, the hedge funds are obliged to a forced buy-in but  I cite two blocks:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Settlement of stock transactions is supposed to occur within three days,  at which time a naked short should become a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver, however  the SEC routinely and automatically grants a number of extensions before  the naked short gets reported as a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver. Most of the short  hedge funds and broker dealers have multiple entities, many offshore, so  they sell large naked short positions from entity to entity. Position  rolls, as they are called, are frequently done broker to broker, or  hedge fund to hedge fund, in block trades that never appear on an  exchange. Each movement resets the time clock for the naked position  becoming a fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver and is a means of quickly getting a company  off of the SHO threshold list. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Since forced buy‚Äìins rarely occur, the other consequences of having a  fail‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver are inconsequential, so it is frequently ignored. Enough  fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver in a given stock will get that stock on the SHO list,  (the SEC's list of stocks that have excessive fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver)‚Äîwhich  should (but rarely does) see increased enforcement. 

&amp;#x200B;

And the most important one:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Short Squeezes only exist in the minds of  na√Øve long share holders. As long as the shorts have the ability to make  a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, they can usually  meet the buy-side demand and keep a lid on the stock price ‚Äî or, better  yet, drop it.   It is myth to think the shorts have to cover in order to realize a  profit. While this may apply to small investors, it does not apply to  the broker dealers. Each day their short position is ‚Äúmarked to market.‚Äù 

So we see now that this whole charade could be attributed not to the short ladder attacks but to counterfeiting stocks? 

It explains how they're able to keep their short positions, the decline in short interest can be attributed to retail investors, the fall in price due to the stock dilution from counterfeited shares etc.

What I'm really asking, and this is for the savviest and most retarded of degenerates here, what if this is all in in vain simply due to the fact that they don't really have to cover like we think they do hence no short squeeze and that they can counterfeit these stocks like they're just paper?

On liking THE Stock.,"Alas, here is my drunken confession. 

I confess that I was no where to be found when my beloved Gamestop began to struggle. I've purchased my fair share of used games, consoles, accessories, etc etc. But it was only when I heard of the short squeeze, that I scrambled to put my stake in Gamestop's future. I bought one stock for \~ $282. Maybe I was easily inspired; maybe I was enamored by the prospect of multiplying my investment. I'll meditate on this to keep myself honest.

To keep myself honest. Because now, my friends, we are at a point in history quite unprecedented. I've adjusted my position - I now hold 5 shares in GME, and I couldn't care less if it multiplies or falters. Because now, my friends, I am invested in this brand, this movement, and the diamon hands of all of you autists.

My friends, keep this mind:

There are only 69.75 Million shares outstanding; the world's population is 7.64 Billion.

Less than 1% of the world will ever be able to own these shares. And this share is now a part of perpetual history.  

I own pieces of history! And I will into posterity. 

This is my drunken rant. 

The stock can drop to zero, but I now count its value immeasurable. 

What can we make of supply and demand when the 1% holding the supply decides to ***NEVER*** make their supply available for sale?

""Once an idea has taken hold in the brain, it's almost impossible to eradicate""

Here is my fully formed, fully understood idea, comrades:

We will HOLD, we will never sell.  We, the 1 percent invested in this nostalgic company. We will hold, and we sill support our Brand.  

We will vest our trust and support in those responsible for the Brand's future. And even if they falter or fail, we will hold because this stock now represents more than the dollars we've invested. It's an idea. A purpose beyond what many will understand. 

This stock is the Tea tossed into the Boston Harbor; the certificate issued for the VOC IPO.

Folks, I would never ask you to risk your lives or well being; but do consider your place in history. If you can afford to hold, then hold, because we are here together, and this story will be told forever.

This is my fucking drunken rant, but we 1% have solidified our place in history.

Godspeed to the board; I pray they do what's needed to keep our company afloat. But even if the stock price drops to less than a dollar, I will HOLD because of the timeless story that's been told.",GME,GME_Initiate,0.0,6,2021-02-03,alas drunken confession confess beloved gamestop began struggle ive purchased fair share used games consoles accessories heard short squeeze scrambled stake gamestops future bought stock maybe easily inspired maybe enamored prospect multiplying investment ill meditate honest honest friends point history quite unprecedented ive adjusted position hold shares gme care multiplies falters friends invested brand movement diamon hands autists friends mind million shares outstanding worlds population billion world able shares share perpetual history pieces history posterity drunken rant stock drop zero count value immeasurable make supply demand holding supply decides make supply available sale idea taken hold brain impossible eradicate fully formed fully understood idea comrades hold sell percent invested nostalgic company hold sill support brand vest trust support responsible brands future falter fail hold stock represents dollars weve invested idea purpose understand stock tea tossed boston harbor certificate issued voc ipo folks ask risk lives consider place history afford hold hold story told forever fucking drunken rant solidified place history godspeed board pray whats needed company afloat stock price drops dollar hold timeless story thats told,443.0

A real story of holding! Why you should üíé üôåüèø,"Years ago early October 2008; a day before the meltdown I shorted Rubber futures in China at around 8400 chinese yuan; i was a kid messing around w commodity futures and felt rubber could go down; 

On the day of the crash, rubber futures did a good dip and obviously i held on since i just made 10% on my capital;

The next day however some institutional diehard pulled the future contracts back up and i m now losing 2-3% of my capital;

I got üìÑ ü§ö and covered my positions; and hindsight being 20:20 rubber went to sub 2000 chinese yuan and being leveraged at around 13% that could ve been a 5-6 times gain on my 50,000 capital.
‚Äî‚Äî-

Fast forward 13 years on, after making some money selling PPEs to the corrupt tory government in the UK, I bought GME 4 shares at 335 average, then 97 shares at 102 average, my current holding is at 108-109ish due to forex and commission expenses.

Why am I telling you this? When the evidence is overwhelmingly in my favour, I should follow that path and not be led by others.

What are some of the evidence? 

1. Huge drop in share prices without intense trading volume; during the rise of GME, trading volume exceeded 130-170 million daily; Today Feb 3rd, volume is less than 30 million, a mere blip on the charts.
2. Failure-to-delivers, need not say more about this;
3. Still cant buy GME or AMC on many platforms thus stunting buy-ins. Hence i suspect many like myself are waiting for liquidity to be transferred from one broker to another. This takes time.
4. Consistent institutional players swapping shares from 1 to another. For example batch selling of shares with value to the thousandth decimal.
5. Amazon veterans joining gamestop to reinvent the brand: this is a big news because executives are headhunted and no execs will do that if the company is a dead beat since thats just going to hurt their reputation for top managerial roles for the rest of their lives.

Everyday i come on GME and WSB to see the memes and people chatting about; these groups transcend race, age, religion, and background; like Gunnery Sergeant Hartman used to say in Full Metal Jacket: we are all equally worthless!

How to look at volume,"Let‚Äôs say that there are 10,000 shares of GME. And let‚Äôs say that 9,999 of us have diamond hands and are never selling. If that one person (who‚Äôs not part of the 9,999) goes and sells their one share of GME, and there‚Äôs only one offer to buy that share, and the offer is $5 per share, then GME is currently trading at $5.

In this way, low volume of trades (in this example, one share being sold one time) doesn‚Äôt reflect the real demand for GME, but instead, reflects that one sale ‚Äî because what *really* reflects the real demand for GME is the 9,999 of us that aren‚Äôt selling.

TL:DR prices based on low volume numbers don‚Äôt reflect demand

"Hear me out: We are battling the Federal Reserve and US Treasury, not just some hedge funds","The hedge fund guys we are fighting are not even that bad of people compared to the really evil HF guys and our politicians. They did their due diligence and were making what would‚Äôve been a good bet 5 years ago. They weren‚Äôt pumping, telling lies, then dumping. They were being truthful. They just got greedy by making too large a bet and not understanding the changing social media dynamics. 

The real threat here is an entire market collapse. As we saw in 2008, just one financial domino falling can lead to complete collapse. There are apparently even pension funds with a stake in Melvin. And even for firms without a stake in Melvin, some of their assets would tank in price if Melvin had to liquidate all their assets. Those firms may then have to liquidate some of their assets if they are highly leveraged, and the dominoes continue to fall. 

Fooled you. Market collapse is not the real threat. It‚Äôs a US dollar/treasury collapse. Ultimately, if the Fed wants to stop the carnage, they‚Äôd have to take assets onto their balance sheets by printing money. While printing money for stimmies and for bailouts and for welfare and to replace the tax revenue we lost due to COVID, etc, etc, etc. The DXY USD index has been falling since March and all assets have been increasing. China is now no longer buying US treasuries and is now SELLING them. The social security trust fund is now SELLING its treasuries because payroll tax collections fell so much during COVID, and it now needs to cash out to make SS payments. Russia and China are now doing some trade in euros, ignoring the current USD reserve currency system. China has its digital Yuan ready to roll out immediately to begin international trade without the USD. The USD slide will happen slowly, then all at once ‚Äì when the smart money moves. Even deflationists like Raoul Pal, Jeff Snider, Brett Johnson, etc agree that hyperinflation is the endgame. We‚Äôll have a brief severe flash of deflation during a liquidity crisis, but there‚Äôs immediate hyperinflation after that. 

No doubt a firm like Citadel would bail out Melvin if they can negotiate a large ownership position. But why do they demand such a high price? Because IT IS RISKY. If GME continues to rise, the parabolic increase in losses could even bankrupt Citadel. That is the first domino. In the latest Grant Williams podcast, Marc Cohodes posited that maybe Yellen is coordinating everything behind closed doors. She was paid $810k by citadel for speaking fees between her tenures at the Fed and Treasury. She is rich, and has many rich friends in financial institutions. Did she go to RH and Citadel in private? Did she promise Citadel a bailout if the deal doesn‚Äôt work out? Is she terrified of a market/USD collapse? Are Melvin/Citadel still massively short? Maybe. It‚Äôs an interesting thought experiment and certainly possible. 

What we are battling for is to have this collapse now. So that we may enjoy the rest of our lives in a sane economy, built on solid fundamentals. Where our hard work results in rewards. The boomers think they can live out the rest of their lives within this bubble, at the expense of their children. Billionaires who exploited our financial system think they can make it to death still believing their riches came from improving resource allocation. 

As we have seen, the smart money is no longer just on Wall St. It‚Äôs spread across the middle class too (on WSB).

Let's say GME teamed up with AMC to put video game arenas in AMC theaters.,"During the day they could give promotions to kids to come to the arcade under a program of re-socializing kids to undo the psychological damage of the lockdowns (an essential upcoming social cause). At night they could function like video game bars which have been very successful here in Chicago (a currently proven business model i.e. Emporium). AMC already has very nice movie theaters across the country, and GME already has tons of video game equipment. I personally would definitely patronize this venture repeatedly when things open up, and I think many across the country would do the same (and across the world if people could play with/against people in other countries while at these arcades).

I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice, but I am someone who wants to help the cause.

I Know How to Initiate the Squeeze,"Dogecoin is a literal money printer as you guys know. I put in like 10k when it was at 0.04 and that was worth into the six figures after 4 hours. If we put as much as we can in to doge, it brings the price up, giving us more profits. If we put some of those profits into GME shares, it‚Äôs free ammo in this war on Wall Street and you don‚Äôt have to risk as much as you do buying GME straight up right now. 

This should help make us profit even more sooner, force the hedge funds hand and end the squeeze sooner, and prevent regular people from getting hurt by this and the stalemate were in now crashing the stock market.

This strategy would allow us to have literally infinite GME shares because the profits of Dogecoin will always be higher than the price of the GME shares. The hedge funds hands will
be forced and this will be done. 

Please upvote and sticky this as soon as possible. If I‚Äôm correct, Dogecoin holders can have this whole GameStop situation over with quickly.

Repost retardo,"We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.

I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user (u/zshub) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.

Our customers have shown the world that investing is for everyone‚Äînot just institutional investors and hedge funds.

Amid this week‚Äôs extraordinary circumstances in the market, we made a tough decision today to temporarily limit buying for certain securities. As a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.

Starting tomorrow, we plan to allow limited buys of these securities. We‚Äôll continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed. 

To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to. 

We stand in support of our customers and the freedom of retail investors to shape their own financial future. Democratizing finance has been our guiding star since our earliest days.

Interesting level 2 market data I've never seen before - anyone know what this means?," 

I'm watching the 15min chart on Gamestonk, and see the price jumping from where it was sitting above 260 and then constant tags to 193.60 for 1 to 10 units each. Anyone know what's causing this is in Lvl 2?

Genuinely curious, I've never seen this before. It's been doing this for ten minutes...

Questions about the expiring short contracts,"I would like to ask this:  
We saw 2 major moves in the prices (after market of course) in the last days, the price had a big pump in both cases.  
We know that they did this after market to avoid the hype during the market.  
For what i've understood, they're opening big longs too, in order to contain the losses and further manipulate the prices (if you drop a big long and open a short at the same time, the price will dip more).  
I mean, they have very skilled traders, it's clear that they are using very sophisticated techniques here.  
It's cristal clear that they replaced part of the expiring contracts with new ones, so the friday deadline is not entirely correct.  
So maybe we got the underlying concept (buy stocks) but we are wrong on the friday target, this could cause demoralization among us.  
We need to understand that if we want to win this war, we have to fight for long time.  
As far as the bulls buy stocks, the shorters are bleeding with their fees, but they can continue to short for a long time.  
We may need to review our strategy, maybe a more skilled trader than me can answer.  
I would like to have a wide debate about that and post it on WSB too, but i can't post there because i'm new.",GME,Anon-146,11.0,1,2021-01-28,ask saw major moves prices market course days price big pump cases know did market avoid hype market ive understood theyre opening big longs order contain losses manipulate prices drop big long open short time price dip mean skilled traders clear using sophisticated techniques cristal clear replaced expiring contracts new ones friday deadline entirely correct maybe got underlying concept buy stocks wrong friday target cause demoralization need understand want win war fight long time far bulls buy stocks shorters bleeding fees continue short long time need review strategy maybe skilled trader answer wide debate post wsb post im new,230.0

You can save people money, boost the economy, help companies hit record profit numbers and save jobs. 

Will need someone with good skills to explain this to normies (I‚Äôve suggested 2 subs, maybe you know more...but if you‚Äôve got wives, maybe they can spread it to their neighborhood circles.)




What if I told you that there‚Äôs a company that has memberships available that gives you $5 monthly certificates, which you can use in store to buy anything, including ALL gift cards (exception visa).

You can get $10 Amazon gift cards for $5 a month. 
If you and your partner have an account each, you can get 2x$10 gift cards for only $10 a month. 


You can do this for any gift card on the wall, with the exception of Visa (because that‚Äôs considered money laundering). 

So gaming gift cards? 
Yes

Amazon? Yes

Restaurants? Yes

Apple? Yes

Imagine how much money you can save. 

The ROI comes out to 400% in one year when you include the 1st complimentary $5 cert when you first join, the 12 monthly $5 certificates, the $5 birthday certificates, plus any additional certificate you redeem from 5000 point offer. 


#Do you have the following?

(Stoc.kTwi.ts could help too)

1. More wrinkles on your brain than your ball sack

2. A clean SFW Reddit account (not tied to these subs) with +3 years of experience and highly knowledgeable with karma.

3. Ability to articulate and demonstrate the benefits of said membership in a concise but easy to follow understandable format.

4. Math expertise to breakdown the ROI for others.

5. Willing to work outside of work hours.

Ok if you do, start working on a post that can be posted in places such as r.fru.gal or r.lif.protip.s and similar places. Those 2 have 20 mil subs combined....

FIrst of all... ofcourse thiS is NOT financial advise you fucking boomer shart! This is my point of view of what I have noted and came across the internet with my smooth brain over the last couple days.

my dear retarded fellow GME autists!! As you for **SURE** already know with your 15.somwhat IQ the literally fucked shorters have no options left... they are soooo fucking fucked in their poopy makers, that they have resorted to and intensifying their controversial dirty tactieks!!

Their only weapons they are using now is creating Bearish BULLSHIT news and trying to speak thru all their channels (uhem uhem Cramer bitch is fake news).... Some even trying to make you believe that they are our friends and on our side (god fucking dammit i hate that sleezy fucker Cramer) or Bullish (spreadig disguised bearish news as they think we wont see)

THEY ARE SPREADING FUD to stop the momentum and the FOMO that has been build on friday. They may and try and flood the market, but we buy all the dips like its chocolate sunday and we smooth brains actually forgot its winter behind the wall!!

DONT forget that diamond hands üíéüñê probably get 72 virgins in heaven which you can share with your wifes boyfriend... I have Islamic roots so I actually am officially allowed to promis you this.

Don't fucking settle for 65$... I know I wont.... don't fucking be a retard and sell at 420.69... howeever you are a less degenerate retard if you sell at 694.20.

REMEMBER GUYS... THE fucking **BASE** VALUE **BEGINS** at 800$ and can go up to 2400 (see link 1 for big brain explanation) . So even if there is a dip on the way to the moon and your lambo's dont be a retard and sell... EVEN if the squeeze doesnt squoze (which is inevitable in my opinion) and everything is fucked just have pati√©nce until our lord and savior RC turn this Blockbuster into the goddamn E-commerce with a value of 50 billion dollar so you can sell at an organic price of 800. In mY OPINION THERE IS NO FUCKING LOSS into jumping into this fucking space-ship.

THIS IS not fucking done!! THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING!!! FUCKING LIVE THIS MOMENT VIVIDLY AND ENJOY!! YOU AND I ARE MAKING HISTORY!!

"IMPORTANT NEWS FOR GME GANG AND NEWCOMERS.... DON'T PANIC WHEN TRADING STOPS TEMPORARY ( LULD), READ ABOUT THIS IN THIS POST.","My fellow retard brethren of GME. Last friday we experience halts on GME trading purely because of a halt/stop of trading that was triggered by what is called a LULD ([click here to read all about LULD](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf)). 

LULD is basically an automatic mechanism which halts trading of a stock if it goes up by 10% in 5 minutes.... GME was soaring and flying to the moon so 10% is nothing but a bitch so it triggered a LULD.... a lot of paper handed bitches paniced and sold to shorters which killed the upward momentum. It is almost certain this will happen again the following days (We are flying duh!!)...

Why you shouldn‚Äôt be mad at people who sell,"As I stay up late tonight, reminiscing on the crazy fucking week I just experienced, listening to the tendie man on repeat, I recall seeing everywhere people being downvoted and shamed for selling GME shares after green Friday. I‚Äôve come to some conclusions.
I‚Äôll start by saying, if you did sell, 1) you‚Äôre kind of retarded, but then again we all are, you just are more. 2) you can still buy and make gains, just don‚Äôt let emotion influence your trades. Look at what happened today and decide if you could‚Äôve made more if you held, make this a learning experience 3) don‚Äôt brag about your pussy retard move by posting about selling a stock when it hurts investors who have invested savings and the company we want to see succeed so much. If you do it, you‚Äôre letting the devil win (AKA Andrew Left). 
My next point is that when people do sell GME, which is expected for any stock (stocks can some time go down before they go up people), it allows a cheaper price to buy in at and therefore even higher gains once the bigger and the biggest gains come. 
Also, what do you think will happen when GME hits 1000$? People will continue to hold? No. People believe in GME, I believe in GME, but there will be selloffs in the low hundreds, at that point we all buy back in and this shit either repeats or everyone moves on to NOK or BB. The main message here is don‚Äôt be a pussy and buy the dip faggot. 
My last point is, it‚Äôs their money. They earned it by stealing their moms credit card and buying stocks on Robinhood like all of us. If they want to sell, I‚Äôll be there to pick it up, and when they get FOMO, they‚Äôll buy in at a higher price from someone who did what they originally did. It‚Äôs a circle of life, but we have to live in harmony. Like I said, if you do sell GME, don‚Äôt post it in WSB, on twitter or on r/GME. You never know if your post could be the cascade. 
Today during the fall from $80 to $50 I was very nervous. I let my emotions get the best of me during the spike and bought more shares at 70$. I was really considering selling all, but now it looks like Monday, 70$ is gonna be what market will be at around 10 am. No one had said anything during the circuit breaker. I grew some diamond encrusted nuts and said here and WSB (which got me 1 day ban because the mods suck cock) in a post, ‚ÄúDO NOT SELL‚Äù. I refreshed and there were ten other people just like me. We are holding gentlemen. DDAY has just started, and Berlin is far from where we are. Give tendie man a listen if you‚Äôre ever down, don‚Äôt get emotional trading next week, and don‚Äôt forget to buy the dips and hold the line, lots of news will be posting negatively about GME, people will tell you to sell, all I have to say is nothing has changed, hold your ground, and may the tendies rain. 

TL; DR:
- It‚Äôs their money
- You buy the shares they sell at a lower price (buying the dip faggot)
- They‚Äôre the ones who miss out

- don‚Äôt get emotional trading

"If you can‚Äôt afford 100 shares, buy deep ITM calls (LEAPS)","Evening everyone! I‚Äôm going to present to you an alternative to buying shares, which is much more capital friendly, effectively a leveraged position, and results in similar price movements.

The trick: deep in the money call, typically dated a bit farther out, aka the LEAPS. If you‚Äôre not familiar with those, I do encourage you to learn a bit about them on YouTube (Kamikaze Cash, for instance), especially if you don‚Äôt know anything about options in general.

With deep ITM calls, you pay mostly for intrinsic value, so the options are **very little** susceptible to IV crush and theta decay, and since they are soo deep in the money, their ‚Äúdelta‚Äù is very close to 1. 

If your‚Äôre not familiar with options greeks, the delta is how much an option‚Äôs value moves when stock moves by $1. One share is basically 1 delta, obviously.

Take $30c 7/16, for example, going for $38.22 at close, when GME was $65. Notice that break even is just $68.22 ($30 strike + $38.22 premium) which means that only $3.22 is the extrinsic value, which can decay, all the rest is intrinsic value and this call‚Äôs delta is about 91%. Also, if GME moves just by over 4.9% by July, your call is profitable. 

Here are two scenarios, to compare:
1. You buy 100 shares at $65, you invested $6500 and if GME goes to $130 and doubles, you made $6500 or 100% of profit.
2. You buy $30c 7/16. Market Maker buys 91 shares to hedge (because delta is 0.91). You invested $3800 dollars. If GME goes to $130, your call will have appreciated by $65 x 0.91 = $59.15, to $97.15. While you‚Äôve made a slightly smaller lump sum, you have earned 155% in #2 vs. 100% in #1, and you used only 2/3 of capital. 

So, instead of buying 200 shares and thus creating 200 delta, you could have bought 3 such calls, for 270 delta (or the number of shares a MM would have to buy to hedge).

So, to summarize:
* your net effect on the share price is similar to buying 100 shares, because delta is close to 1 and MMs buy shares to hedge when they sell calls
* Much more capital friendly, you get a lot more delta per dollar invested
* Much higher profits, in percents, for the same absolute stock movement, because your initial investment is much less.

Downsides? Well, your profits move much more quickly, but so do your losses, and this is a call, after all, so you do risk losing it all if GME falls below the strike. However, your losses are capped at the premium you paid, vs. the total share price when you buy shares.

GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze [1] and infinite short squeeze [2]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

Note: A primer on gamma squeeze:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/

Market Maker [1] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1.	‚Å†Few GME shares to hedge.
2.	‚Å†Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3.	‚Å†January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4.	‚Å†Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

Infinite Gamma Squeeze

Should million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying [1]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral. If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

tldr;

There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.

Edit1: Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1.	‚Å†They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2.	‚Å†Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

Edit2:

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

$GME gang: We will win because we have nothing left to lose,"I'm likely a good deal older than most of the ""19 year old degenerates"" on this subreddit (I'm 35). 

Last January things were going pretty good. I had a job, I was engaged to be married, and I had finally felt like an ""adult.""

Then COVID hit, taking everything down. I was put on furlough and then cut from work. The government gave me back my $600--yipee--and told me to fuck off. Meanwhile, after a brief blip, Wall Street bounced back, reaching record highs, making back everything they lost, and then some.

It's a funny thing, because I've seen this movie before. It was called the ""Global Financial Crisis."" Back then, they blamed a worldwide economic collapse on people overleveraging into debt. Not the banks and lenders handing out that debt like candy, of course--the people who didn't know any better and trusted what they were told were to blame for accepting all the rotten loans. I was 21 then, just out of college, and had difficulty finding work. And after the shit hit the fan, it was the banks which were bailed out, not the people. There was a whole fucking movement around this--Occupy Wall Street--that had some good ideas but ultimately went nowhere.

So now I'm sitting back, watching the GME story after a horrific 2020. After the GFC, there were laws put into place to heavily restrict blatant short selling. There were guard rails, in other words, to make sure nothing disastrous could occur in the pReCiOuS mArKeTs. Those EXACT laws are what Melvin et all are breaking in their egregious and idiotic short selling of GME. (How the HELL do you short more shares than are available?) And look at all the articles coming out once again: it's \*our\* fault GME is so volatile. We're causing all this price action, somehow outsmarting billionaire hedges for lulz. We're the reckless and insane ones.

Everyone mentions Michael Burry but no one talks about Mark Baum aka Steve Eisman aka Steve Carrell's character. The events in his specific life were largely fictionalized in The Big Short, but the fact is he had big ""fuck corruption"" energy in the film, and that's largely what motivated him to bet against CDOs.

So you're telling me for the low low price of $60 I can buy a few shares, join in unity with others who are struggling and never got help, make the funds performing illegal activity bleed a billion a week, \*and\* make a few bucks doing it? Hell yes, I'm in GME gang.

What all these articles and funds don't understand is we're not doing this because it's ""fun"" or because we're a hive mind or because we think we are trading gurus. We're doing it because we have no other options left. We're doing it because we want a crack at getting out of the chains YOU put us in. Fuck you. You'll keep trying to scare us, but we don't care, because all we have to do is smile and wait, while every day that passes and dollar that rises causes you pain.

Hold the line, everyone. We're going to $1,000. The squeeze has yet to squoze.

When GME ever closes above $690 for one single day I will buy out one entire GameStop location and make #GameStopChallenge trending.,"Posting this bc it's keep getting auto-deleted from r/wsb (feel free to post this for me if you can)

TL;DR at the bottom.

Recently, MrBeast  bought out 5 GameStop stores and all the merchandise/stock they had available only to give it away as [his YouTube content](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/mrbeast-spends-insane-amount-buying-out-five-stores-just-to-give-it-all-away-1492607/).

We all know there's a historical scale short squeeze coming soon which will cause a legendary redistribution of wealth.

We all know üåàüêª are fucked with something they've never been penetrated by.

We are all buying shares at any given price like rabid investors &amp; üíéüôå.

I sold my 1/29 calls way too early Friday and bought shares almost at the top at $68 and will be buying WAY more shares come Monday 1/25.

And let this post be another one of my commitment to this historical movement.

When GME ever closes above $690 for one single day, I will be buying out one entire GameStop store and donate most of the merchandise to a charity and make **#GameStopChallenge** trending.

This in effect will achieve 5 great things:

1. Help boost GameStop sales.
2. Potentially save a closing store by: a. helping the sales of that one location &amp; b. by giving it enough public attention and keeping its flow and foot traffic steady for months with a potential media/news coverage.
3. Returning favor to society and community.
4. Potentially start a movement which will be followed by my other autists in this sub and looping effects 1 \~ 3 above.
5. Giving WSB a good reputation, positive media coverage, and helping the community grow and mature into something net neutral or positive.

Disclaimer: No I'm not a influencer or any kind of internet celebrity and no I don't have a YouTube channel that I wish to create, shill, and grow. This is purely for the meme spirit.

P.S. $690 is just an arbitrary number and will not sell below $1000.

**TL;DR: I buy everything in one GameStop when GME close $690.**

Hold your shares so your fellow comrades can make $$$ on calls so they can buy more shares so that you can make money on your calls. Rinse repeat until $1000.
2. **Place orders for shares at premarket** PLEASE; especially those who already made $$$ on calls, this small investment will pay you back tenfold. If you wasn't planning to buy shares all I ask is to buy JUST 1 before the bell rings for the sake of everyone here; you included.
3.  **DIAMOND FUCKING HANDS NO MATTER WHAT I DONT CARE IF THIS SHIT DIPS TO 50 DO NOT SELL WHEN IT IS SUSPENDED**. Place a order for 1 share (or more) every time we get suspended or it dips at open. Paper hands exposes themselves on dips and they are a bigger threat to us than Melvin Capital.

Why you should buy powerup Pro from gamestop,"Heres my idea.

In Lemon mans latest rant ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=CitronResearch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=CitronResearch)) , he says, the only way to ""save gamestop is actually buying something from them"". So I do my research. Mods I am not breaking any rules saying this, do your own research before investing anything.

My idea is all in the PowerupPro subscription. [https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone)

Powerup pro is gamestops subscription service. For 15$ a month you get 5$ upfront and 5$ every month for the year. In total this is 65 USD. This is free money, and way less volatile than actual stocks. What you can do with this is wait 1 year, buy a highly sought-after release (ie COD, some game that has market scarcity) from games stop at the midnight release, buy it for 65$ or whatever price it is (even though you yourself have only paid 15$, and you can then either play this new expensive game at a massive discount or, you can go on ebay and make a 300% profit on your investment, all while helping gamestop (only saying this because gamestop is part of my childhood and minor business does not = fluctuations on the open market).

Also for 5$ extra you can get yourself a copy of [Gameinformer.com](https://gameinformer.com/), which is a fucking steal for something to have on your coffee table.

I'd like your input, and again do your own due diligence. This is an investing forum, and this is a great small game which honestly has alot less risk than other stocks priced similarly. Let me know what you think

**TLDR: The whole Citron attack, the news articles, Cramer etc was planned by pissed off hedge-funds (mainly Melvin) who want WSB to appear to be a single, coordinated market manipulating entity - Source: London Hedge Fund PM**

Hi everyone,

Time to finally spill the beans about what's really going on here. WSB deserves to know.

Long-time lurker here. This is a crazy but true story so buckle-up for a wild-ride. Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods, before the Shitron shit went down. Most of the complex, sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP. Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged (takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see) but here are the things which I can release. It's very hard to prove everything because it's based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don't have a recording of my calls with him or OIP, but here's proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I'm talking about:

[OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would](https://imgur.com/a/5TmznIF)

**Storytime:**

Earlier this week (I'm British) I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel (truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially) warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market (he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC) . I contacted the mods as fast as possible, I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy, some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently. I gave them my encrypted email and phone. I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time, but also talked to Bacon Futures and¬†[u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/)¬†about this situation. Everything I told them panned out, in the specific ways I said (I didn't know it would be Citron tweeting, but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head-on). Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end. The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding.

**But anyways, it's time you guys hear what my source had to say:**

He warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short-selling of GME and that the recent short/gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books. Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg, firms have been keeping an eye on the sub. But this was the final straw, when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short-selling. They were pissed off, royally, and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base (WSB) who were making money too easily, and that too at their expense.

Their plan is simple.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **First of all, get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily. Notice how there wasn't much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up?**¬†But recently, everyone's focused on WSB. They have to push the narrative that we are out-of-control retail investors (Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol) who are an institution, a solid group, manipulating markets. This turns the public perception of WSB, what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn, into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short-term greed.¬†**Barrons, Cramer, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, even VICE FUCKING NEWS**¬†etc everyone's on us. Never had this much coverage. It's all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this. It's also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short-selling and that's a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard.  
 
2. **Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on, explicitly.**¬†I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we'd rattled the hornet's nest and that my source didn't want to give me a name but he said they were well-known short-sellers. He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin (remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video?) and others with an unexpected entrance (to spice things up and again draw public attention) and paint a straw-man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up (and not a combination of Cohen coming in, general turnaround buying, naked-short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB). Not only does the market listen to Citron in general, so some puts can finally go in-the-money (notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow?), but it draws huge attention.¬†**Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors, and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do**. The whole situation doesn't make sense from a logical point of view... Why would¬†**Citron enter out of nowhere, shill for Melvin, consistently repeat that GME is going to $20, postpone their speech for ""inauguration"", get ""hacked by too many people"" and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement?**  
 

The whole markets are watching now, Institutions vs Retail. Citron takes on all GME buyers. Surprisingly enough, having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold (OIP passed the message to the senior mods), the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like ""**We are a force to be reckoned with"" ""We are taking over"" ""It's time for us to have a voice""**. My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact/calling out between short-sellers and WSB.¬†**He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly, paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us**. I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call, that the hedge-fund muscle (didn't know it was fucking Shitron then) were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers.¬†**Literally, everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would**. This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story. They were bleeding before, they got their buddy Cramer (who's admitted to openly manipulating markets) to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity. ""Shore up the balance sheet"" and some BS. Constantly moving from side to side. The whole thing is completely off. As I consistently said to the mods in my messages (images), the twitter account plays right into their hands and it's basically doing their job for them. You couldn't get more explicit than saying that you're ""**taking over""**¬†a market and a ""**force to be reckoned with""**. We couldn't be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit. Even if we did control the stock market, the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known (Hi Papa Elon) to be fucking strict.

**My opinion**: Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time. They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with $100 can buy options and make money. Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year. They want us out of the game. It's that simple. But don't worry, they'll probably put restrictions in the name of ""protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility"". They'll ban your options without owning the underlying (but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions) just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail's hands (freedom my arse). Pattern day trader rules, hello?¬†**In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong, and they'll pin it on ""the uneducated retail investors"".**

To preserve the future of this sub, we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution. Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call, and kudos to him.¬†**But the whole GME situation has gone too far, and you know it has when Cramer, Shitron, Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME**.¬†**Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which ""speaks on behalf of WSB""**. There's bull gang, bear gang, cash gang, theta gang etc etc.

Fellow autists, I hope you can see this. As for the lead mods, please heed my warnings. As fun as it is crushing the institutions, they have much more power then us retail investors. The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader.¬†**Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit**. The game is rigged, always has been. Stick to meme stocks, go back to inversing each other to see who wins. Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for. Thanks.

High profiles do not help anyone, and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub.¬†**We may win the battle, but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up, make laws to ruin their competition, manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy, revolving door with the SEC.**

Citron, Cramer, Melvin. Fuck you. You guys are the true scum of the earth. I don't care that you're short GME, I care that you're taking part in collusion, market manipulation via naked shorting, and the intentional villification of small time day traders.

Just like in 2008, you're coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA. Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud, you're villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you've done for decades and keep minting money.

GME DD - Andrew Left was lying! Fund Managers are sweating this.,"One of Andrew Left's cases for selling $GME was the fact that shorts can still borrow shares easily and aren't paying high interest rates to hold these shares! This is **blasphemy**. On E-Trade right now its literally **impossible** to short the stock (no shares available, check picture). E-Trade is one of the largest trading platforms in the world!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zrtz5c8e0uc61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=784fbbb3de426dc7f2cad36c7730e0150d871c4e

And when you were able to short the stock the borrow rates were **astronomical**..... not ""average"" as he suggests.... I have posted proof of that as well (I was short GME for a while. Gay bear I know). He paints a picture as if these huge hedge funds are short GME and willing to wait it out for months for their ""thesis"" to prove true. I also believe this is false.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgcbhjdh0uc61.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c38c9160f110330fc35d7aa710911923c7296b

**The scary thing about short positions is when they move against you is the get larger.** What starts out as a $10million dollar bet against Gamestop at $5 share price is now a $100million dollar bet if the stock price hits $50. Also consider that many of these funds were probably doubling down as the stock ran up. See how a position that was maybe 1% of your portfolio can quickly become 20% or even more.

What Andrew doesn't want to admit is some of these big funds are holding **massive** bags. I guarantee you it's getting to the point where the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Shares are getting called back, margin terms are changing (it happened at E-trade), and firms are paying super high interest rates just to hold their position. Not to mention this is happening in the middle of a crazy bull run. Do fund managers really want to continue holding this position when so much other stuff is hitting all time highs?

Basically what fund managers are beginning to be say to themselves is something along the lines of ""**the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""** Frankly the original thesis doesn't even matter anymore. What matters is the stock is up nearly 1000% in the last 6 months and their short position has become so large that it's a massive liability. They aren't stupid. They a gamma  squeeze could send this thing to $1,000.

What I'm saying is that investors are applying so much pressure that they're going to break. The thesis of the company changed when Ryan Cohen came on board. That's when you saw institutional **smart/big** money get on the long side. The companies who are short want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to dip to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits. Remember that the people making these decisions got there because they were almost always **correct**. They are feeling the pressure. One bad trade can unravel everything you've worked for in wallstreet.

**What This Means**: Buy as many shares as you can and hold no matter what. As long as we don't sell we will avoid a massive sell-off. Their aren't enough shares available to short for them to drive down the price artificially.

I was thinking that it might be good to have a different way for this to end. Below are the goals that I had in mind for an amicable ending to this situation and a proposed framework to reach that goal.

# Goals

* Enhance GME‚Äôs financial stability
* Provide capital for execution of strategic growth plan
* Provide an ownership structure supportive of the growth plan
* Ensure no retail investor is a bag holder
   * i.e. Some that made $1000/share and some that missed the squeeze and only made have $100/share post squeeze
* Stabilize volatility in the stock
* Distribute the short squeeze spoils to shareholders more tax efficiently than a short term capital gains windfall
* Offer the bears a (painful but acceptable) exit strategy
   * We cannot kill them or beat them within an inch of their life or they will never agree.  This is kind of like a reverse bankruptcy or setting them up on a payment plan

# Mechanism

Have a shareholder vote at the 2021 Gamestop Annual Meeting (June 2021), to offer the following capital raise and exit for bears.

* Shorts pay Gamestop $420.69 for every Class A share that is shorted to create the missing shares and settle any outstanding short interest
   * Gamestop fulfills any phantom shares to investors who have been sold a phantom share by a short.
   * Gamestop retires any phantom shares that were held by a short to minimize the expansion of Class A shares
* Gamestop creates a Class C with no voting rights (similar to Alphabet or Zillow Group)
   * This will ensure supportive RC has a lot of room to maneuver on strategic execution
   * This will make it easier to do subsequent equity raises for growth
* Gamestop uses the $420.69/share to create a fund for a special dividend for Class A shareholders
   * Special dividend will be paid out $21 quarterly over 5 years
   * The first dividend will actually take the form of 1 share of Class C stock for each share of class A
      * GME keeps this as a \~1.4-1.5 Billion cash from an equity raise which will stabilize the company‚Äôs financials
   * 19 payments of $21 to each Class A shareholder will then proceed
   * If the bears cannot afford this upfront, they can be put on a payment plan
   * Bears can contain their losses at \~30 Billion and move on
* Bears have 60 days to accept these terms or else the price for the offer goes up by $10/share/month

My Position: 1685 shares, 5 16C 4/16

How would GME's board benefit from a short squeeze?,"Obviously rockets are coming and RC is getting super excited for it. While people have been discussing this though, I've been wondering: how does the squeeze directly benefit the board? I assume that it helps them by allowing them to use the shelf offering at the top of the squeeze so that they can get another $100 million while barely watering down the current shareholders (and therefore barely  watering down their own shares \*cough\* RC's 20% \*cough\*). I'm not sure how the shelf offering works but maybe they can even directly go to Melvin and offer to let them cover $100 million worth of shares Gabe has short based on some super high figure (&gt;$100 a share)(i.e. essentially issue the shares to Gabe at an absurdly high price). Based on the involvement of RC in GME, it wouldn't be surprising if he was in on creating the shelf offering and now wants the squeeze to happen so that he and his friends have $100 million more to play with.

Some Fundamental GME Numbers,"Here is a summary of the Statement of Operations for you folks that like the fundamental stuff.

You can see why the stock price has dropped heading into 2019, quarterly results continued to deteriorate. Most recently SG&amp;A have decreased which should help any additional sales go straight to the bottom line(profit). Analysts consensus Estimate for Q4 2020 is $2290 million. Holiday sales disappointed with $1770 million which puts meeting analysts expectations at risk unless console inventory can be replenished and sold before the end of January. If not, then more demand and sales gets pushed into Q1 2021 (Feb and onward).

With SG&amp;A decreasing from the closure of less profitable stores and other cost cutting measures and with the boost in Net Sales expected for Q4 2020, SG&amp;A-to-Gross Profit (bottom left chart) should fall back below 100% as it should.

Consensus analyst expectations is for EPS of +1.42 which would be the highest its ever been in the last 3 years. It will also be the first profitable quarter without Asset or Goodwill Impairments hampering profits.

A GameStop owned digital marketplace that can compete with Steam,"New GME investor. Currently, I see my GME position as a short term position however I'm now trying to evaluate whether I should go long term (2+ years). The low market cap, high short interest, and Cohen potentially paving the way to a new era for the company is extremely attractive.  If a large squeeze doesn't occur in the short term, I see it happening eventually if Cohen executes.  


 One of the questions that has been on my mind is regarding the PC world. I've never shopped at GameStop ever since I switched from Xbox to PC. I can see the angle on peripherals, PC parts, PC building kiosks, but how about games? Imo there's profit to be had for GameStop in this space. Billions are being made off of DLC sales. However I don't see the company penetrating through this market unless they offer some real competition against Steam.   


With the recent shakeup of GameStop's Board of Directors (and potentially Cohen replacing Sherman as CEO in the near future), there's some reason to be optimistic about the company shifting towards e-commerce.

Short Interest continues to climb (squeeze not done),"Recent bearish StockTwit posts and news articles continue to say that the Short Squeeze has already occurred in January. As of January 15, 2021 the amount of shares sold short has increased to new historic highs creating a Short Interest of 114% of the shares outstanding.

A short squeeze occurs when there is heavy short covering that raises the price, which then squeezes more shorts that bought at those higher prices, and continues.

The shorts have doubled down on their shorting instead of covering, so I'll continue to hold my long position until they're all squeezed out.

I've excluded articles that are neutral or critical in a fair manner. There are also other bearish articles from other sources like Barrons that are not part of this list.

Its unfortunately, because there are weak minded investors that read this stuff, especially since its what pops up when you google GME stock, and could have possibly swayed some from investing in 2020.

Question regarding my 4/16 $24 calls,"Hi, I have 10 4/16 GME $24 calls that are up 264% right now.

My question is: Would it be smart to hold onto these calls as GME continues to rise, or sell a portion and buy further OTM calls with a shorter expiry (thinking 1/29 $55c)? My line of thinking is that having more calls = more $. After reading the gamma squeeze DD it seems certain that GME could reach well over $55 by next week.

1. Will game disks be disappearing and people buy more games directly from Playstation/Switch/Steam? In this case, gameStop might lose a big part of the revenue right? For context, I don't play these games so I don't have any clue.

Comparisons to Blockbuster,"I have read many comments from doubters saying GameStop is going to be the next Blockbuster.  I'm writing this here to say that that's a highly an INACCURATE comprason, and not really the case with GameStop.

There are four key factors that contributed to BB's rapid decline and eventual bankruptcy:

1) Not getting rid of late fees earlier

2) Not embracing online shopping soon enough

3) Competition with better business models

4) Uncertainty about the company's direction by management

If one were to look at these four factors and try to apply them to GameStop, this is what we get, according to how I see it:

1) GameStop's revenue relies heavily on SELLING, as opposed to RENTING.  Part of the appeal of Netflix when it started out was that it was uniquely positioned in having NO late fees.

That said, I think it would be wise for GameStop to start renting out titles that have been on the market for at least a year.  Players are not likely to pay even half price for games that have been out for a long time, so many of them continue to sit on store shelves collecting dust.  This is especially true for Nintendo games - the price of most of their main titles are rarely discounted even years after their release.  If GameStop launches a plan to reasonably charge people, in store, to rent out games on a monthly basis (with no late fees), they'll get an edge over big-box retailers.

2) GameStop already has its own app, and the company intends on continuously improving it.  Recent reviews I've read suggests many customers are unhappy with its latest update.  GameStop also offers same day delivery for many US residents - something Blockbuster tried in an attempt to compete with Netflix but didn't work out because they were too late to the game

3) It seems like EVERY video game publisher has their own digital storefronts now - not just the major console developers.  Luckily, GameStop's management is aware of this and has adopted the mantra of ""if you can't beat them, join them"".  Earlier in the year, GameStop struck a mutually beneficial deal with Microsoft to take a portion of revenue of EVERY download (not just games) AND online subscription that occurs on their newest Xbox-line.  It also likely that GameStop will strike more deals with other gaming companies.

Blockbuster was given a chance to buy Netflix for $50 million in 2000.  They could have even partnered with them for a year to see how things would turn out.  Instead, they laughed... Guess Netflix got the last laugh.

4) Yes, the Dec 8 earnings call was a disappointment.  Yes, I hate the boomers running this company too.  Yes, I want Ryan Cohen to launch a hostile takeover.  Yes, I see their act of diluting shares as them poisoning any takeover bids.

BUT, you would have to be a fool to think that management actively wants GameStop to fail.  They have closed down many stores not out of spite for the company, but because they've gotten TOO EXPENSIVE to continue operating.  They paid off A LOT of debt recently, and will buy back up 63% of their outstanding senior notes LITERALLY TOMORROW (Dec. 11) in a bid to pay off EVEN MORE DEBT.  

You know how much debt Blockbluster had when they declared bankruptcy?  Almost $1 billion.

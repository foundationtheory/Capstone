# 0. INTRO

The future is probabilistic. ‚ÄúAll models are wrong, but some are useful‚Äù.

In this subreddit, we have been reading many theories about the squeeze.

**The prevalent narrative is that the situation will escalate in the next 2 or 3 weeks in the vicinity of the 19th of March. To me, this sounds a lot like the ‚ÄúThe war will be over by Christmas‚Äù kind of rhetoric.**

**Let me be very clear about this, the war ending by christmas is every ape dream scenario: A squeeze before the end of march would make me and many others in here millionaires. AND This DD does not exclude such a possibility.**

BTW Did you know that million of people voluntarily enlisted in 1914 out of fear of missing out‚Ä¶ Yeah that‚Äôs right FOMO existed back then.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Reality](https://preview.redd.it/5m477klh4um61.png?width=448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6102884dae2392250dccdc461d5f299918814dff)

This discussion purpose is an attempt to describe how this situation can evolve if no squeezes happen in the short term and give some reasons why it might evolve that way. It's also an attempt to warn apes about the specifics of option plays.

# 1. How The ‚ÄúGamma swarm‚Äù is getting gamma f*****d

Each week a squeeze doesn't occur, thousands of option contracts for high strike prices expire worthless. This also means that thousand of newbie retail investors who opened call positions in a YOLO mode are burning cash **at an alarming rate**

**Sometimes these losses completely offset the gain of being long on shares (and that's a pity fellow apes, it really is)**

Let me give you an example of how one can get gamma screwed.

1. Let‚Äôs take the pricing of a 3/19 425c at the beginning of the day on Friday, due to a small surge the price of the contract quickly jumped to over 3200$ (POINT 1 in the chart below). Some smooth brained ape might think... OOH squeeze now let's buy call and spend 3200$ for the contract.
2. By the end of the day as the price remained mostly flat, that same 3/19 425c is now worth less than 1600$ (POINT 2 in the chart below)

https://preview.redd.it/3nqc3qk05um61.png?width=431&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0439b4e530b8dec4bd66b0385a42b83876d1b90d

**50% OPTION PRICE DROP MY DEAR APES ‚Äì IN AN OVERALL SLIGHTLY GREENISH DAY FOR GME !!!!**

Sure, from point 1 to point 2, price went down roughly 5% and almost 1 full trading time passed. However, it's mostly the realized volatility and decrease of it that generated a huge pricing swing in the option chain.

Let‚Äôs go back to our 3/19 425c. So, after a very nice and relaxing weekend market opens and GME continues to go up at a constant rate .

**Best case scenario, squeeze is squeezsquashled we are rich. End of story.**

Other case and likely scenario, GME continues to go up, but not enough for you to materialize, you start your week 50% down, you hold tight because it‚Äôs too painful to leave and sell your contract at loss.

**Let‚Äôs say GME closes at 350$ on Friday 19th March, what would happen to your 425c if you kept it till the end? That‚Äôs right.... worthless. Even with a 32% intraweek GME stock performance.**

**END WEEK HISTORIC CLOSE PRICE FOR GME:**

**Friday 12th March**  **264.5$**

**Friday 5th March**  **137.74$**

**Friday 26th February 101.74$**

**Friday 19 February  40.59$**

*I do not want to scare people, but an emphasis has been put on hedge funds bleeding out because of interest rates on short position, but nobody ever mentions that retail is bleeding out because of far-fetched option plays in the name of a gamma squeeze.*

If I were a long whale, I would not help retail, I would benefit both from some HF bleeding out and part of retail bleeding out. The best way to achieve this purpose is a constant, sustained but controlled growth in the price of the underlying, precisely what we have been witnessing in recent weeks.

Also, from a long whale perspective, making huge profits without destabilizing the market is the greatest of plays.

**CONCLUSION**

**--- PLEASE if you do not fully understand the intricacies of options just BUY SHARES AND HOLD THEM!!!-----**

**--- PLEASE if you absolutely want to play option hero, buy a book on options, read it during the weekend and start acting like a winner----**

# 2. Increased cost of Rolling forward position

In order to continue to  create upwards pressure for gamma squeezes, a solution would be to roll forward positions and buy calls for future dates as we go. BUT as i pointed out before, we have a huge problem.... **OPTIONS PLAYS ARE GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE**

Because the price of the underlying is steadily on the rise, less and less people will be able to buy contracts and so actively participate to the option play.

This can cause two things:

a) Momentum for a big squeeze to fade out

b) Retail progressively being pushed out from the option scene and participation in the leveraged huge gains shifting to benefit big long whales only

Three weeks ago, you could easily YOLO 1000$ in a multi-week spanned play with unlimited upside that could potentially turn you in a millionaire. And many are already millionaires thanks to it.

Problem here is that the very same play now might as well cost 10000$... **you ask me that's a helluva entry barrier...**

AND Rising entry price for YOLO plays means fewer and fewer people will be able to afford them.

**In the light of this i believe The absolute best thing that could happen to us right now is a 10:1 reverse split by GME.**

**I can assure you that people negotiating cheap contracts EN MASSE, is one of the worst nightmares of the establishment right now.**

# 3. Bleeding out by day trading shares

On February 24 there was a peak of over 180$ a share, some people probably decided to sell part of their position. There is nothing wrong with selling if you need the money for other purposes.

I really trust you apes here on r/GME are smarter than this, participating in this subreddit is probably a protective factor against panic selling (and selling in general)

SO What I am about to say here is nothing new for you apes,

**BUT unfortunately people elsewhere are completely missing out the bigger picture...**

I am currently following many European telegram and discord groups, people in these groups do not  understand the difference between a play like GME or buying NAKD or cryptos‚Ä¶. And so they day trade GME just as they would day trade the rest‚Ä¶..

One of the main reasons, is that most Spanish/French/Italian people and other don't know enough English to fully understand everything.

This sucks, because it‚Äôs very difficult to explain to them, why GME is very different.

**ANYWAY**

Probably most non r/GME people who sold at the peak at 180 felt good about their decision-making skills by looking at GME trading lower for the next couple of days.

Likewise, those who sold over 300 in the latest peak are probably feeling very confident about their decision-making skills right now.

**If you sold for 180 on Feb24 and you re-bought your shares at more than 180, you are already losing money and putting yourself in a never-ending cycle of sell low, buy high.**

I know that psychologically most of the wannabe day traders think that they can outsmart the system by trading by ""stairs"", selling the highs, and buying the lows. Just know this, you are competing against   high frequency trading computers constantly trying to steal your money and capable of crashing the market in 10 minutes.

**NOTHING IS LOST, NOTHING IS CREATED, EVERYTHING IS TRANSFORMED**

**All the money you voluntarily forfeit goes to Kelvin, Shitadel and other players behaving in a more balanced and patient way than you are.**

GME has been very forgiving by mostly being on a uptrend, but I can assure you **that you don‚Äôt want to be bag holding at 10k or 100k a share. And you quickly arrive there by constantly opening and closing positions.**

**Please don‚Äôt open a fractional share at 92k for the trip to 100k and risk the downside to 900 (projected value according to potential fundamentals in the best scenario). If you intend to put that money into GME anyway, the second-best moment to buy shares is always NOW (the first being yesterday). There is limit between YOLO and being dumb.**

**If you are bullish on GME, HODLING ALL THE WAY IS THE WAY**. (This will never be stressed enough)

**80% of day traders lose money. First rule of making money, don‚Äôt f\*\*\* lose money.**

# 4. Open interest for later dates

Let‚Äôs take 21 January 2022 as an example. OPEN INTEREST FOR FAR OTM CALLS is already 8224 contracts which represents 822,400 shares‚Ä¶ 82 million dollars‚Äô worth of premium as we speak.

I have not been tracking when (and at what price) these have been opened but the reason why someone would play such a long play in time are exactly  the same reasons that pushed DFV to do so last year:

**THE AWARENESS THAT GME IS A LONG PLAY AND NOT JUST A BLITZKRIEG SQUEEZE OPPORTUNITY.**

Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1642723200&amp;p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1642723200&amp;p=GME)

# 5. Simple Conclusion

My prediction is that if a squeeze is not triggered by some huge catalyst  in the short term, the price of GME will steadily go up at a rate that will  bleed out both the short sellers and the impatient retailers who are just long for a limited time by opening yolo option plays.

I will not detail possible catalysts in here, because there are other in depth DD that cover them well !

**I feel that the ""immediate squeeze narrative"" is pushing inexperienced people to yolo unhedged options plays for March and potentially miss out on GME if the squeeze happens on later dates.**

**So APES whatever you do with your money, just make sure you can follow the endgame till the end, even if things last longer than expected.... PEACE !**

**SIDENOTE:**

Wow, I just noticed that Selling GME far OTM puts for next year practically out yields corporate bonds‚Ä¶

Check Your Biases: Some Reminders for Processing Information,"Hi all,

Here‚Äôs another weekend pep talk on behavioral economics and psychology. I noted an increase of reassuring posts after market close yesterday, which I think was a response to the relatively ‚Äúboring‚Äù action of Thursday and Friday‚Äîespecially after dramatic price increases earlier in the week, followed by anticipation for gamma squeezing by the weekend.

This post reiterates what was said in [last week‚Äôs pep talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzxbzm/be_adamant_some_reminders_for_managing_behavior/):

&gt;It is easy to be a mountain for it is an effortless position: one need not change their strategy precisely because remaining constant *is* the strategy. Conversely, any and every time the enemy devises a new tactic, they are seeking a crack in the mountain. Until the battle is finished, expect abruptness and novelty from them.

The community continues to [identify FUD tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1oc5u/shill_tactics_a_classification_based_on_infection/) and [their operations](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3ti8j/broviet_comes_clean_melvin_citadel_shorts/). So, this post isn‚Äôt about the external crashing waves, but the internal stability of the mountain. In less poetic terms, I present here an overview of cognitive biases (in addition to the community favorite, confirmation bias) so that readers can increase integrity in processing information‚Äîboth in the GME situation and in their daily life. There are countless biases studied in the realm of psychology; the ones below are what I consider most relevant (at this time) for those invested in GME.

For those unfamiliar with the term, a *cognitive bias* is some flaw in thinking that leads to less than rational conclusions. My thesis is simple: Recognize the common gaps in thinking, so that you become a better consumer of information and, therefore, a better decision-maker.

**TL;DR**

I present an overview of cognitive biases with the following lessons:

* Confirmation Bias: positivity is good, but don't forfeit critical thinking
* Anchoring: your price of admission shapes your reactions
* Forecast Illusion: beware of prophets who seek to profit
* Hindsight Bias: everything makes sense after the fact
* Story Bias: a desire for a meaningful narrative can skew one's perceptions

# Confirmation Bias

Obligatory Buffett quote: ‚ÄúWhat the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.‚Äù Much of the momentum behind GME since trading halted on January 28 (never forget) is owed to the mix of due diligence, sense-making, and quality meme posts in this community. It‚Äôs become a meme in itself that members take confirmation bias with their morning coffee‚Äîa daily ritual of sorts.

Let‚Äôs face it: It feels good to have our ideas verified. Especially when money is involved, one seeks to process information fast and to feel good about the intake. The danger is when this processing lacks critical thinking. Questioning what is presented by mainstream media (and carrying out investigations based on that questioning) is what gives this community strength. However, the conclusions drawn so far should not become unquestionable themselves. An openness for ongoing dialogue acts as a test so that ideas are refined further. An idea or viewpoint is not right based on the number of upvotes received, but on the facts presented and the reasoning that stems from those facts.

I trust many already take precaution against confirmation bias, but a reminder can only help. The next biases are more subtle.

# Anchoring

In the face of uncertainty, the human mind grasps at any piece of information to make sense of a situation. When it comes to investing, a stock‚Äôs price is a common starting point. This price, or one‚Äôs ‚Äúprice of admission,‚Äù becomes a frame of reference for making sense of market volatility. In terms of GME, anchoring plays out on two levels:

* First, your price of admission frames your reaction to gains and losses. If you entered a position at $300+ back in late January, right before the trading halts (as yours truly did), then the subsequent GME bleeding *hurt*. If you entered a position when the price was in the single- or double-digits, then the bleeding was less painful (aside from the feeling of missing out on selling at an all-time high).
* Second, the price action can itself become an anchor. Based on closing prices pulled from Yahoo Finance, GME increased 103.94% on February 24 from the previous day. February 25, March 1, March 8, March 9: these dates saw an increase of at least 18% from their previous day, respectively. These are abnormal gains that can skew expectations. (How many of you anticipated price spikes this past Thursday and/or Friday?)

I‚Äôve two pieces of advice: First, focus on the bigger picture. (‚ÄúWhen in doubt, zoom out!‚Äù) As others have said, GME‚Äôs price was in the $40s several weeks ago. The trend is favorable for those long GME, even when day-to-day activity is sometimes flat.

Second, keep basic math in mind. Whether your price of admission was $100 or $200 or $300, in the event of a squeeze that takes the price of the stock to $10,000, then those prices differ by one or two percentage points. At higher target prices, those differences become even more negligible.

To quote Buffett again: ‚ÄúPrice is what you pay, value is what you get.‚Äù Focus less on the price of admission, and more on what you paid to get admission for.

# Forecast Illusion

Whenever a forecast is made‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs for the gamma squeeze or MOASS or Ryan Cohen being named CEO, whatever‚Äîthe poster is conjuring an illusion. As momentum for GME increases, so too, do these posts.

The posters have incentive to provide forecasts. When their prediction comes true, they stand to gain publicity, get invited for interviews, gain karma, etc. When their prediction does not come to pass, people forget and move on (well, unless they were heavily betting on the prediction coming true). The asymmetry in upside and downside for the poster means it becomes a numbers game: the more prophecies they push out, the higher their chance of being coincidentally correct.

At their worst, these posts contain sermonizing and self-promotion, which creates a positive feedback loop that reinforces further predictions. I challenge anyone who considers themselves a critical thinker to work on separating a person from the content of their ideas. Truly valuable insights stand on their own.

In turn, I challenge those prone to making predictions to consider what happens to the community‚Äôs morale when predictions fail to pass (see: the reassuring posts made following yesterday‚Äôs market close). Sure, you can put up disclaimers, but those seem to be circumstantially convenient in that they‚Äôre referenced when predictions fail, and ignored when predictions succeed.

# Hindsight Bias

Forecasting is about predicting the future. Hindsight is about making sense of the past. This bias describes the tendency for people to ascribe meaning to past events. Think of the ‚Äúcauses‚Äù for the World Wars or for global financial crises. These causes almost always create a sense of causality, when, one must ask: If the reasons were so clear, why wasn‚Äôt the negative result prevented?

One flavor of content in this community is the ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what happened‚Äù post. These posts are helpful to the extent that they inform readers of events, but reader beware: the ability to explain does not equal the ability to predict. By definition, a *theory* is a framework of analysis that a) explains a phenomenon and b) provides tools to make predictions. Theories stand when they can be tested, and when their assumptions or results are proven false, they must be open to change. To do otherwise is a disservice to the concept of due diligence.

To be clear: I am fond of explanatory notes. I‚Äôve learned a lot in the last couple months about the financial world because of commentary in this community. Where I lose interest (and trust) is when I come across the tone of ‚ÄúI knew/called it.‚Äù

# Story Bias

Finally, in both forecasting and hindsight biases, there‚Äôs a psychological preference for narratives. Whether one is providing an explanation or a prediction, there‚Äôs a tendency to frame content in terms of a story. It‚Äôs a compelling force that defines the heroes and villains of a situation, the drama between them, and the hopes and fears associated with the conflict. (For me, this bias has shown up through framing the GME situation as a strategic battle, though that‚Äôs due to recently reading books on warfare, and I‚Äôve acknowledged that.)

No doubt you have a story that you tell yourself, about your position in the world and your relationships to your activities and to other people. A personal story is how we make sense of ourselves and experiences. At best, it‚Äôs a source of resilience in the face of challenge. Just don‚Äôt let it get out of hand.

There‚Äôs a tendency to narrate the intentions of the players in this game (e.g., ‚Äútriggering the SSR rule to lead up to a gamma squeeze‚Äù), and there‚Äôs talk about the movies and documentaries to follow this situation. These are examples of the preference for a good story. Just take caution (as with all the other biases): sometimes one can get carried away and assign significance to the insignificant. Avoid letting the desire for a good story affect your perceptions.

# Closing Thoughts

I hope this post gives the reader new terminology for certain faults in thinking. Often, to know something by name is the starting point for developing deeper understanding.

For those interested in learning more about cognitive biases, I recommend *The Art of Thinking Clearly* by Rolf Dobelli. I referenced this book heavily for this post, and it‚Äôs a resource I turn to for frequent reminders.

Stimmy Tactics,"UK ape here but payday is tuesday, so i'll be coming in then in solidarity.

Here are some of my thoughts going into Monday regarding using these funds to defend my previous investment:

1. We are not on the SSR list for monday. I don't care if we hit this value for Tuesday, it's a nice benefit, but the main point here is that while we aren't on it, we're vulnerable to the short attacks. Hitting every bid while volume is low to drop the price as much as possible.

To combat this: Stay vigilant when volume is drying up, usually 12-2 is when this happens. There could be some great entry points if they attempt this again. A nail in the hedgies coffin would be a bounce back to HIGHER than they drop it from. 

Note, as we've known for a while the price doesn't matter when they start doing this type of market manipulation. The operative factor is the amount of shares we and the other long whales have vs the shares they need to cover. Both naked shorts and those hidden in the ETFs.

2. Find rational pricepoints using Techical Analysis, do your own or get some insights from the other DD posts here. What i'm going to do is not chase the opening run-up if there is one. Some will, correctly anticipating the new money headed for the stock. We saw on the 10th what FOMO can do to GME. Run ups like no other stock in existence followed by market manipulation. 

I've noticed that the hedgies tend to try their shit at these support levels, naturally winding back on the RSI to retest a stable level and then wham hit all of the lower bids and stop losses.

I am using this money to defend my previous investment like a hedgefund would. As i invested a while ago i'm here to display my confidence in the stock at these levels, much like they are trying to undermine it. Confidence in a stock comes from stable support levels and bouncing back from fuckery, not crazy run ups in 3 hours.

Its with steady price action and gains that we build a basis and wall street accepts our obvious not a (dead) cat narrative. Risk/Reward looks jucier when we have lots of steady lines of support, rather than chasing the potential monday morning rocket - which hopefully we're all already on. It doesn't help us if we run up to 400 but we're all out of money for another final attack before the catalysts of the next few weeks. IMO stability at these levels is all we need. Their only way out is to scare us, and if i were a hedgie i'd be looking to let us run out of ammo and then come at us at the last moment they can.

**TLDR: APE STEADY HAND WITH FUNDS READY FOR FUCKERY AND SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF HEDGIES IF THEY TRY IT - IF ALL GOES WELL FINDING SENSIBLE SUPPORT LEVELS TO REINFORCE LATER IN THE WEEK. NOT CHASING A RUN UP.**

If short interest is more than 100%, that is the amount of shares shorted is more than the available float, then how do the shorters ever buy back the amount of shares they have shorted if there aren‚Äôt enough.

Clearing something up about shorts and calls,"I've seen some people on here saying that shorts may be buying calls to cover their shorts. No. They're not. 

Buying calls is literally always more expensive than buying the shares at the moment. The price of a call is the price of the shares plus the time premium (and a few other things, such as volatility, the risk-free interest rate, etc.). If you want to buy stock for as cheap as possible, you just buy straight shares.

Now, it is possible that if a huge short is *getting ready* to cover their shares, they could buy a bunch of calls first, because in that case they'd profit from the increase in the price of the stock that their covering would bring, and hedge funds are greedy. Hedge funds could also buy calls to hide their short positions, giving the appearance of covering without actually covering. But hedge funds are not buying calls simply to cover their short. That's literally only more expensive than simply buying shares.

TLDR: shorts are not buying calls to cover their shares. That costs them more money than simply buying shares due to the time premium.",GME,1615664056,meta-cognizant,32,6,True,2021-03-13

I think that the 800c are Melvin‚Äôs. Hear me out.,"Remember the capital injection they received from Citadel, and the shady AF answers both CEOs when asked about the situation. Hold on to that memory. 

Alright, Melvin &amp; Co. knew that their opponent (retail) was relying heavily on the SI-data that was being published, and that there is no possible way to manipulate/bribe all financial institutions reporting the data. 
*Remember that Melvin &amp; Co. want us to sell, in order to cover their positions for cheap*
They knew that in order to achieve this, they would need to find a way to decrease the SI% GREATLY in a short (*pun intended*) amount of time.

What I think they did next is the following: Citadel wrote a bunch of counterfeit call options at 800$, and passed them on to Melvin in the form of a bailout. 2.75B$ worth of 800c to be precise.

Why? To help Melvin ‚Äònet out‚Äô their short positions, reducing the SI greatly, thus creating the idea that they covered their short position to such great lengths, that the short squeeze everyone wanted, was not possible anymore. To put more power behind this, they reached out to all MSM, who in turn put out HUGE amount of information about this (watch the Jim Cramer interview from back in the day to understand how HFs do this).

Since there is also a link between Citadel and Robinhood, (possibly?) they decided to make sure RH halted the buy-influx for a bit, so that the (at the time) surging stock would peak and come crashing down. The INSANE amount of IV (and possible IV-crush on the way down) was also the reason that a lot of smart money stayed away from GME around end-of-January.

They hoped that this would result in the massive sell-off they anticipated, but it didn‚Äôt.

Would everyone please STOP upvoting accounts that are totally SUS??!! Take a second and check the account- Too many shills are trying to blend in!,"I may be shooting myself in the foot here but I don‚Äôt care. I have a relatively new account at about 2 months old but I am here legit and think you can tell by my account. I‚Äôm ‚Äúreal‚Äù.  

I came here for the unemployment info but since then I have stumbled onto the $GME saga and I‚Äôm glad I did!
From being stressed about getting my benefits to having something to be excited about is amazing- I‚Äôm grateful. I am learning as much as I can as fast as I can. And I‚Äôve laughed a LOT. 

I started reading at WSB and when I tried to post they wouldn‚Äôt let me cuz I was too new- GOOD FOR THEM! It also looks like the amount of Karma was factored in too. GOOD. It keeps the thread more pure and I‚Äôm cool with that. I‚Äôm not savvy enough and I‚Äôm cool with that.

Not being able to be part of it was a bummer so I came here and I was glad! I could post and feel a part of this even tho I know there is no ‚Äúwe‚Äù... it‚Äôs fun. Now tho- I find myself not looking cuz I can‚Äôt tell who‚Äôs legit. I really like following the OG‚Äôs-but it‚Äôs getting harder to tell who they are.

The reason I‚Äôm not sure is because, when I look, 7 out of 10 accounts appear SUS. I didn‚Äôt come here to follow a bunch of shills. The only way to know is to look at the account- but these SUS accounts are getting way too many upvotes which help them appear more legit as time goes on. Pretty soon it will be too hard to see who‚Äôs who. When I see an account that‚Äôs 3 yrs old with less than 300 karma it looks SUS. When I see a 5 to 20 day account talking about how they are ‚Äúfellow apes‚Äù etc, it looks SUS.
I‚Äôm sure the MODs have a better way to tell but maybe it shouldn‚Äôt have to fall completely to them- and even if it does you can‚Äôt un-ring a bell. 

I love the excitement- and I bought my shares on the high side. I watched them go to $40 losing basically 80% of my money (on paper) but I held because I‚Äôm not into losing money and that‚Äôs what I decided I would do when I purchased them. I stuck with my original logic and I‚Äôm glad I did. And so you know I only put in what I could stomach losing. 

Now that I see green it‚Äôs fantastic- and I‚Äôm still going to hold. But the SUS accounts mostly appear to be hyping the stock- which makes me wonder ü§îü§î It‚Äôs FUD reversed...

I can only come up with 2 reasons for shills to hype the stock. They either WANT us to hold to be bag holders OR (which feels right to me) they are attempting to blend in and when the next low happens they will be screaming for everyone to dump their shares. It will seem like they are legit because they were ‚Äúso into the stock‚Äù until then. And because they keep getting upvoted it will be harder to tell who they are.

I know upvoting is part of the Reddit charm for your average Subs but this AIN‚ÄôT your average Sub. 

I feel kind of weird even posting this cuz I‚Äôm so new - I‚Äôll probably get an AutoBot that won‚Äôt let me anyway. Just wanted to share what I see as a potential bummer down the road.

All that being said I don‚Äôt totally rely on what other ppl say- but I can only learn so fast and I wanted to jump on this so I like reading what the ppl who are smarter than me have to say. I will still question everything- and there are a couple of ppl on here that I believe in whole heartedly. I would just hate to see all these shills have an impact on ppl who stand to lose a lot more money than me.

Ok- I‚Äôm prepared to be downvoted or ignored...but I hope ppl keep their eyes open!

I belive having hyped up catalysts has been a posivity thing for us.," 

It's been a fucking while now, people have not given up and I truely belive they will continue fighting till it's over.

There has been a lot of hyped up days followed by nothing. First it was long anticipated FINRA data revealing short interest. There was congress, SSR, crazy option activity and a lot more.

Since all the way back to where this whole thing started the HFs never backed down. They doubled down, tripled down, quadrupled down etc until they were in so much shit that the consequences of their risk would be passed on to someone else.

Now if you were the HFs and you saw reddit hyping up all of these potential catalysts, of course you would do everything in your power to prevent ANYTHING from happening to make them question themselves to ensue FUD. Worst case the HFs are fucked anyway. So what do they do? They continue doubling down by creating shares out of thin air, shorting, creating fat dips to scare people, hiding shorts, playing hot potato with failure to deliver etc.

How could this be a good thing you ask? More fuel to the rocket! There's an ocean of rocket fuel at this point. We'll be hitting a moon in a different galaxy by the time this thing takes off. They're still not done with their fuckery, but I'm calm as ever. After GME spiked again no amount of dirty tricks can get them out, the restriction on buying was their last and only chance to get out of it alive. Yet they will still try but it will only add more fuel to the rocket. If nothing happens the 19th I don't give a fuck. I trust that people will hold and the inevitable will happen eventually.

You might think they're dumb and that retail obviously won't fold but take a moment to think about it from a bigger point of view. I'm sure you've all seen posts about family members, financial advisers and colleges all screaming to sell, but can you blame them? Afterall GME is presented by the media as an irresponsible unfavoured gamble and that is what the HFs don't get... They've used their dirty tricks for years against retail investors without much resistance if any at all. They don't understand why nothing is working, why is this group of people suddenly seeing through all of the tricks...

AI Models Predicts 3.85 Billion Dollar Investment in GME,"Hey all,

I was poking around my computer last night and came across a new feature on Microsoft Windows that lets you run AI predictions right from your desktop!  I built a new model using this cutting edge technology named Calculator (*pronounced: kal-kyuh-ley-ter)* and fed in the numbers below.

* Approximately 149,000,000 Americans will receive a stimulus check of $1,400
* 40% of recipients plan to invest 50% into the stock market
   * Data suggests number may be closer to 53% plan to invest, but wanted to be conservative
* Of the invested dollars, 28% will go into Meme stocks, with 33% of that going into GME.
* I did *not* estimate a time line on this investment - only note that 80% of people have direct deposit and should be receiving stimulus checks within the next week

Needless to say, when I fed these numbers in - I was blown away by the outputs and had to share them *immediately*!

GME is the best opportunity for financial independence,"Squeze aside, think about that - The money you will make with GME will give you financial independence.

Now let‚Äôs say you made 100K from GME (If we squeze as high as everybody is saying everybody with only 1 share will make that much) and now you keep trading with those 100K. You make 5% in one day which turns your 100K in 105K. Its much easier to get rich with a high amount of money.

Its possible to double your money in one year but 5000 doubled is still only 10000. Doubling 100K is 200K which is even nicer.

I'm very long on $GME but I have some unanswered questions I need answered to ease my anxiety,"Fellow apes, I've been reading so much and learning so much about the intricacies of wallstreet since I got on the GME train in early Jan. But I just have some questions that are still in the grey and I'm hoping an ape with a slightly more wrinkled brain can answer them for me.

1) If the squeeze is inevitable, why don't the hedgies start covering at the current price of 265 to cut their losses rather than being squeezed for much much more later?

2) I understand the shorts are hidden in ETFs, hence why the reported SI is much lower than it should be. But  how can we confirm the hidden shorts are still there?

3) What is the worst case scenario for us üíéüôåü¶ç? Realistically the govt wouldn't step in because they have so much to gain and everything to lose if they interrupt a free market. So what else should we plan for?

I've always grown up with the ideology of ""Hope for the best and plan for the worst""

I'm gonna HODL to the moon but I just need to put my anxiety at ease. 

Would be very grateful to hear input from u/rensole or u/heyitspixeL on these questions. 

This has been one of the greatest things to happen in my life since my dad was killed two years ago. It's given me reason to thrive. I wake up excited everyday now and I have started making plans for my future. 

Many thanks to all the apes in this amazing community.

THIS IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. Do not miss this opportunity.,"Everybody is going to tell you it‚Äôs a gamble and it‚Äôs insane to invest in GME at anything over even let‚Äôs say 20..? They are wrong. Flat out. Just like that. They are wrong. I‚Äôve been getting told for weeks to stop buying, take gains, leave, the squeeze happened, blah blah blah, but everyday that I open my account GameStop gets more and more traction. My friend told me if I was so sure on this that I would‚Äôve emptied all my positions and go all in on GME. Well, safe to say challenge accepted. They all said I didn‚Äôt know the fundamentals of the market, when in fact that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs driving GameStop, when you short 100% 150% fucking Christ I seen it could be up to 200% ( some hidden in ITM calls ) and all the shares get ate up before you cover what do fundamentals say?

The Long Game,"With the recent DD and posts about dates, I feel like there's a few things that need to be said.

Don't worry about what day things are going to happen. If you've been in since the first run, you know anything can happen at any time. Wednesday was an example of that.

However, when you know your enemy, you know the potential angles of attack. That Wednesday when the price hit 170, just a tiny sliver of fear sunk into my head but I had an instant light bulb moment

""This is what they want"" 
Then I started laughing because it was so obvious.
Boom üí• GME 170&gt;260

When you have the facts and understand the situation at hand, nothing will scare you. The more informed you apes are, the better. Fucking Read.

They will use everything they have at their disposal. You're seeing it, fake DD, shills, bots, etc.

Okay, so you've got that down. 

I heard an interesting fact the other day. (Please correct me if I'm wrong)

Micheal Burry, who shorted the housing crisis didn't see any real gains until 2 years after. Some of us have already realized gains. And that was just on the cusp of when it was about to pop before they cheated. 

(not all shorts are bad. In this case he saw the bullshit of '08)

Be prepared to play The Long Game

Apart from being informed, this will terrify them.
The fact that we are willing to ride it out and constantly buy over days and months while they bleed.

That Wednesday showed us that there's some delicious shorts above 350.
Because they shorted down from 400-500ish in January.

It's not a question of if, but when.

Buy. Hold. Read. 
They can't scare you.
They can't take your shares.

Don‚Äôt overcomplicate the DD.,"Don‚Äôt over complicate shit.

It‚Äôs all about supply and demand.

We can talk all day about NSCC, naked shorts, covered calls, gamma squeezes, options contracts, delta hedging, but all that does is confuses people and makes them doubt. The ONLY thing that matters is supply and demand.

As long as you hold shares that you purchased with cash, you are a thorn in their side.  

Repeat after me:

70 million shares total.

23.8 million belong to insiders of the company.

That leaves 46.2 million to go around for every ETF, index fund, options contract, and üíéüôåüèªü¶ç.

If there are anymore than that circulating on the market, they are synthetic and synthetics are costing someone interest.  

The Housing market crash happened in 2007, its 2021 now.  I don‚Äôt mind waiting 14 years holding on to these bad boys. 

Can they drag it out forever? Maybe. Can they rob Peter to pay Paul? Definitely.  

Would I like it to go to 100k, of course. Do I care if it drops? No because I still have the demand for it and will buy more.

I will NOT sell a single share till MOASS levels. I‚Äôm sure we all wanted some percentage of our investment back, the perfect exit strategy.

Yesterday the amount of $300-$400 3/12 Calls increased by 57.7%; $800 3/12 Calls by 32.6%,"Sup fellow diamond hands,

yesterday I was a bit sceptical of u/HeyItsPixeL's DD ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m23tep/what\_just\_happened\_here\_is\_what\_i\_think\_prepare/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m23tep/what_just_happened_here_is_what_i_think_prepare/)). The theory-crafting felt a bit over the top and I did not agree with the claim of 60k new calls, as well as the dip created by HF who are long. As a disclaimer, my portfolio is also 100% GME and I'm holding because I believe in the momentum, us ü¶ç and **üöÄ**.

The data is out since some time already, so I made the effort to compare the reported Open Interest from yesterday (OI from 3/9) and from today (OI from 3/10) Source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) . The changes are:

# 11246 new 3/12 calls between $300-$400 (57.7% increase). 

# 7252 new 3/12 calls with a strike of $800 (32.6% increase).

# Regarding yesterday üìâ

For yesterdays happening, I concluded that the stock was rising way too fast, **we would have reached 500$ on friday without even needing a gamma squeez**e. Reason for this was mostly the momentum and the dried up liquidity. **HF who are long had no reason to create a SSR trap on wednesday midday**, since this would have been way to costly. If they wanted to have GME on SSR yesterday, they would have dropped the price at market open. 

So what do I think happened? With a **40% gain** during half of a trading day with no end in sight, **the shorts needed to fucking stop the momentum**. They hit the break, brought the price down, b**ut did surely not want GME to be on SSR**. In the range of 260-240$ during the drop, HF who are long sniffed their chance for a cheap SSR trap, boarded the train and further decreased the price. 

&amp;#x200B;

[3\/10 Price dip](https://preview.redd.it/op09xgjg2gm61.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2d3c8a97be31a339664866564763ed3343d23ba)

Can you see the candlestick and the short stop **at \~$261** with even a small price increase? This might be the window where our long-HF-friends stepped in with their sell-off, triggering the SSR. **It is also interesting that the buy-up after the dip happens to exactly this same amount, it surely cannot be our HF-friends buying their shares back** üëÄüëÄ**?**  The call-outs for the prewritten news of the dip do also support this theory. **Also, with todays premarket activity, the daily low of $238,5 was fucking obvious.** This might have been the cheapest SSR trap on earth. congratulations to everyone who could grap some stocks at this price, unfortunately I had already invested my full portfolio into GME ü¶ç

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't get me wrong, I appreciate every DD out there and a big thumbs up to** u/HeyItsPixeL **and his effort, but we should not forget analysing the data.** Also,  it might not be wrong to address different points of view.

&amp;#x200B;

# TLDR:

# We got a hefty increase of new calls for friday, adding fuel to the üöÄ. While there might be different theories of what caused yesterday's dip, either way it is a sign that SHORTS ARE FUCKED and clearly shows again the power plays of the different HFs. Because of the interest increase of the call chain, we can have certain expectations for tomorrow.

**However, it is not unusual that calls expire. Be ready that** üçå**might not ripe tomorrow.**

You don‚Äôt just need to rely on a short squeeze!,"I posted in the daily chat and a few people liked it, so I think it‚Äôs worth reinforcing here. I have next to no experience in trading and this certainly isn‚Äôt financial advice but I think it‚Äôs a timely reminder that short squeeze or not, in my view all will not be lost (albeit I believe the squeeze is yet to be squoze)

$GME had some well publicised issues with its business model that along with a global pandemic and delays in the release of new consoles had hedge funds drooling at the prospect of massive profits from taking up huge short positions. However, we all know that has not happened. 

Why? Well even apart from DFV and others being pissed with hedge funds trying to drive a potentially viable business into the ground causing massive lay offs, they recognised that with Ryan Cohen being appointed to the board and immediately bringing in other hugely experienced execs, $GME‚Äôs future could  be a lot brighter!

The e-commerce industry is worth over ¬£300bn annually and savvy investors like DFV saw that by pivoting its business model, $GME could see its fundamentals put it in a position where the stock‚Äôs fair value could be in the mid hundreds in the long term.

And that‚Äôs the point. No one knows the future, but regardless of whether the short squeeze happens today, next week or never, if Cohen and co. make the right decisions, $GME could and should be worth hundreds of dollars per share in its own right in the future, based on its fundamentals alone.

So when you see a little dip in the price when it is wavering in the low hundreds, don‚Äôt panic, strengthen your grip with your üíé üôåüèª a little harder, because at this price you‚Äôre effectively playing with two aces in the hole! 

TL:DR, I know shit about stock but I believe what DFV are others saying when they say that not only is a short squeeze possible (probable) the stock is undervalued at this price based on its future prospects. üöÄ",GME,1615490479,EssexDan,0,1,True,2021-03-11

Food options for Melvin Cap and Citadel,"Since our friends at Melvin Cap and citadel might be lights on cash in the next few months, I thought I‚Äôd help them out with some thrifty recipes/meal plans I‚Äôve picked up over the years. They have never had to deal with food insecurity. 

1) toast with peanut butter. Excellent source of calories.
2) ramen noodles. This is the most cost efficient way of living. I had a roommate who lived exclusively on ramen. He told me that it only costs $150 if you buy it in bulk. 
3) tuna. Just straight tuna from a can. Add salt as required. Used to eat this myself. 
4) canned soup. You can get them cheaper if you buy the damaged cans (just a little added value for you)
5) spam. Classic choice.

""Should retail investors be allowed to invest for themselves in the market?""

Read that again. Read it a few times. It was not a joke. The government will not help us. The SEC and FINRA will not help us. The media not only won't help us, they'll go out of their way to sow dissent and fear. And according to the powers that be, pretty soon we might not even be able to help ourselves.

I've got some young friends on the Hill looking to make names for themselves, a few buddies in Finance that loathe their existence, and a psychologist or two looking to study market mechanics. What I'd like to do, if at all possible, is create a source of information from a small group of non-anonymous entities, with you guys as the driver of what to look into. I'd even like to get some of the legends like /u/rensole involved (feel free to delete this if you'd rather not have it be a distraction right now, king ‚ù§)

If there's fuckery going on in Congress or in the SEC and you guys point it out, we look into it and see what we can find. If market movers are up to no good, you point them out and we look into it. So on and so forth. This could be its own site, but ideally would be a framework in conjuction with its own subreddit from which to source information from the masses. Whatever you guys find and is popular, we'd put into layman's terms and broadcast as a video report hosted on a platform immune to takedown notices and the like. 

No recommendations, no financial advice, just a snapshot of what's going on with regulation, stock movements, market psychology, etc, so that you can be better equipped to make up your own minds. And ultimately, I'd like to have it generate enough pull to start lobbying for fair investment litigation on the behalf of retail investors. 


All that said, it's a tall task, and one that is on the far back burner for now. You know as well as I do that the assclowns calling the shots will try to use it as ammunition, so I wouldn't dare try to get anything off the ground until this all shakes out.

I'll not sell on downward moves.,"**This is not financial advise. I just like the stock. This is only my opinion. You should do your own research and follow your own plan.**

There have been several [posts suggesting to wait for a top during the squeeze and sell on downward movements](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/). I don't think this works. I think this is just day-trading crap and not working. Day traders know way more about all this than I do, yet 90 percent of them go broke.

To sell, there has to be a buyer. But the downwards price movement happens exactly because there are no buyers. If I try to sell during a downwards move I compete with all the other apes that what to sell the current price. So the price will likely drop further. Shitadel et al can simply wait for it to bottom out and everyone sells at the low point. I fully expect them to push the price down during the squeeze, trigger trailing stop losses (please read up why those are a bad idea), and get my shares for cheap. ***IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN, SHITADEL!***

In the best case this is downwards selling just nonsense, in the worst case it will make me sell for little gains.

**Let me say again that this is just my opinion; not financial advise. You do your own research.**

I'll sell on the way up to what I expect to be the top. I won't put numbers here, I'll aim at the end boss, [because why not](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lz53l2/there_is_plenty_enough_money_in_the_world_to_pay/)? I expect institutions to do the same. [They are greed AF and the whole thing is just too epic to not try](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzpomj/people_keep_talking_like_the/).

I'll probably sell a few shares here and there once we see 6-digit figures, but keep a good chunk for the end boss.

If it really doesn't go that high, I can still sell my shares afterwards for a good price. Or simply become long-term GME owner.

I remember when the fools were only on the radio, with no web presence (because web pages were not quite widely accepted yet). ***Please, please suspend your ""wise"" sensibility when it comes to GME.***

GME is an outlier event, not something normative of market behavior and expectations. If the MOASS (Mother of all short squeezes) happens, there will be documentaries made to unpack what on earth happened. And moves like the recent increased accountability measures put forth by the DTCCCC will shore up any weaknesses that allow for the existence of synthetic stocks (and yes I know that some naked shorting is a byproduct of a healthy, working market ecosystem, but there will definitely be some deep attention given to the conditions that created this once-in-a-lifetime situation.)

All this to say:

1. **Fcking stop profit-taking** thinking all this talk of the moon is ""irrational exuberance."" It's not. Read through some of the well-thought-out DD on this thread and others. There is some good objective analysis on why conditions are emerging where WE FCKING SET THE PRICE.
2. **HODL means HOLD**. I realize that when we reach our age, all this lingo shit can be confusing but fcking HOLD your shares until we reach a price point that makes you doubt whether you are in a dream or awake. Again, there is nothing remotely normative about this brewing scenario.
3. **Start to see the GME opportunity as more than an investment**. It's a social movement.

Transferring out of RH FOMO,"

Thinking of the hearing the other month on how easily citadel threw RH under the buss and washed their hands..Anywho, I initiated a transfer to another broker today.

I know its for the best, and I never really had doubts but now FOMO is hitting me HARD! Realistically, there are more dates we need to hit (next hearing, quarterly earnings, etc), the new rules don't take place until 10 days from tomorrow that puts hedgies on their heels. I know it will take days to peak, and the sheer number of shorts will drag this out longer than other squeezes....but I'm half tempted to call up first thing tomorrow and telling them to cancel the transfer. I thought this would put me at ease but I am STRESSING. The thought of loosing so much of my initial investments is horrifying... If I lose it because the sqozening fails or whatever.

"Forbes Article: WTF?? Am I a Predator??? NO. I'm a Momma Bear Who Just wants to Provide For Her Kids, and Splurge on herself once in a while. Is that too much to ask????","TL/DR:  Forbes can suck it.  This is my rant.  NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

&amp;#x200B;

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday.  The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

&amp;#x200B;

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting us on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said we weren't just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, it was just another headfake, y'all.  The writer was framing US as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

&amp;#x200B;

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES,  are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

&amp;#x200B;

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.  

&amp;#x200B;

NOBODY says or does anything about it.  Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress.  The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors.  They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

&amp;#x200B;

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired.  I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips.  I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

&amp;#x200B;

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car.  (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further)  And since  I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either.  So YA, Momma wants a car.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

&amp;#x200B;

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch. 

&amp;#x200B;

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims.  ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

&amp;#x200B;

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME???  My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market.  The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

&amp;#x200B;

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life!  And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY. 

&amp;#x200B;

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

&amp;#x200B;

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed. 

&amp;#x200B;

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out.  But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

&amp;#x200B;

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to ride the rapids.  To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming.  Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie.  That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

&amp;#x200B;

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view.  I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer.  Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

&amp;#x200B;

THATS not greedy.   Its INEVITABLE.

4. invest in some professional counsel (finance, security, legal)
5. buy a piece of land off the grid
6. invest in home batteries for our solar panels
7. get our modest home garden running smoothly
8. invest in the people around me and myself with continued education (the kind of stuff you want to learn about, but can't afford the time for)

First question : Last time people also thought it would go up to from anywhere between 1000 and 100k. Why will this be any different? What ended the last squeeze anyway?

March 19th looks to be a very important date for call options, as the call options for the weeks after that date are a literal fraction of the 19th. Does this mean that the squeeze is going to happen or start on the 19th? Or atleast ROCKET on that date? Does it take a couple of days after March 19th for the Market maker's ""finding"" the shares to affect the market?

DOUBLE YOUR GME EXIT PRICES APES!!!,"This serves some purposes (dumb ape need smart ape help with numbers):

69: The longer we collectively hold, the higher the price goes. It‚Äôs simple ape logic and something we are all well versed in. 

420: When estimating your exit price you MUST calculate for capital gains taxes or you will screw yourself out of this once in a lifetime experience. Depending on how much you profit, you‚Äôre gonna be paying Uncle Sam (or Daddy Thor, Mommy Merkel, Great Great Great Great Great Grandma Elizabeth, or wherever tf you‚Äôre from) anywhere from 30-50% of whatever you make. Therefore if you‚Äôre exit price is $5k, in the end you may only make $2,500k per share after taxes. 

100: this number reflects the percentage of my ass the HFs need to be prepared to eat.

THE QUESTION EVERYONE IS AVOIDING,"My friends, we‚Äôve accomplished something amazing already. What we‚Äôve been able to prove with this whole GME situation is historic. 

BUT, the question that needs to be discussed more is why do you think the powers at be won‚Äôt put an end to GME when it hits the early thousands? Sure I think we can all agree it COULD hit 100k +, but with everything we‚Äôve seen and everything we know, WHY wouldn‚Äôt they just suspend trading and blow this thing up whenever it gets truly astronomical?

Would love to hear your opinions.

"My DD, based on sentiment. The lottery play.","Let me start by saying, I‚Äôm not the smartest person. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent though. And you‚Äôll agree with that statement if you feel someone with multiple degrees, and earning more than $250k per year is intelligent. Now that I‚Äôve tooted my own horn, let‚Äôs continue to the DD. 

We have lottery tickets. Any stock is a lottery ticket. But how much is it worth? Therein lies the rub. It‚Äôs worth what you believe it‚Äôs worth. Back in Feb, I believed it was worth 1.5k a share. That‚Äôs why I bought more lottery tickets. 

Now, I didn‚Äôt sell my entire position in the past few weeks, because I don‚Äôt believe these tickets I‚Äôve bought are only worth $37k altogether. 

Smart and influential people have been saying that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing because not everyone can with the lottery. I bet to differ. 

I‚Äôve bought 149 lottery tickets (as far as you know). It‚Äôs a bet. I‚Äôm ok if I lose all that money. But here‚Äôs what I think they‚Äôre worth:

10 tickets are worth $500 each. 
50 tickets are worth $1,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth $2,000 each 
10 tickets are worth $5,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth $7,000 each. 
20 tickets are worth $10,000 each. 
10 tickets are worth in between 10k-40k
10 tickets are worth $50k
10 tickets are worth $100k
8 tickets are worth &gt;$100k. 
1 ticket is priceless. 

That goes to my future child. It is a lesson: Money will come and go. Presidents will change. Climate will change. Things will be great. Things will be awful. The only constant is you, and your mind. Invest in yourself, success will follow. 

So that was my Sunday morning hangover rant. Now that I‚Äôve read it over myself, it does sound like I think I‚Äôm amazing. Whatever. I don‚Äôt give a fuck, I am amazing. We‚Äôre ALL fucking amazing. It‚Äôs my life, and I‚Äôd like to live it thinking I‚Äôm the most amazingest person in this entire world. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm visiting my sister in Manhattan and def had too many gin and tonics last night. But that‚Äôs ok, it was planned. First weekend off in 2 weeks. My time is precious. Even this hangover is precious. Stay well, my friends.

Calling fellow GME apes and boffins: I need your help to piece together a complete timeline of events for GME üìÖü¶çüöÄ,"**This is an extension of** [**my previous post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxu6nf/i_created_a_webpage_to_draw_attention_to_the_gme/) **about** [**https://gmetruth.com**](https://gmetruth.com/)

Thanks to everyone who added to the conversation over on the [previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lxu6nf/i_created_a_webpage_to_draw_attention_to_the_gme/) \- as promised I've made some changes and updates to the site which were requested by you guys - I also received a lot of emails about referencing/indexing, so I've added that in too. Site traffic is increasing daily and is now ranking on Google for the following search terms:

**Top Hit:** gme truth, truth gme, the truth about gme, the truth gme

**3rd Page:** gamestop the truth

*Not bad for 3.5 days, ideally we want the site to rank top for 'gamestop the truth' so that anyone who gets wind of foul play and whom doesn't already know about what's been going on will see this before the 30 other bogus mainstream media articles that claim ""we (the people of Reddit) are the problem"".*

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

You might be wondering why I've started a new thread...

The next step I'm undertaking is to **formulate a timeline of events to challenge the narrative which is being presented in the mainstream media**. As an example [check out this website](https://timeline-of-failure.com/) which was created last year to illuminate the UK's Conservative party's mishandling of Coronavirus - the plan is to build something similar (albeit more detailed) which provides a visual timeline of events relating to GME.

There are a few parts to this, first and foremost the data, it needs to be **high quality DD** ([I love rocket](https://gmetruth.com/rocket.html) jokes as much as the next internet sleuth, but integrity is important here). Obviously there are threads including [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lj1wqv/a_comprehensive_compilation_of_all_due_diligence/) which I will pour through over the next few weeks, the same goes for any posts on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) / [r/Wallstreetbetsnew](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/) that have valuable insight. As with the homepage, once this timeline is collated and built I will share the site here again and ask for feedback so that our collective understanding is fully accounted for and any mistakes can be flushed out. *Unlike the media, our version of events will be factual.*

# What I need from my fellow apes:

**#1 Information/Facts and Opinions:**

There are likely things that are not covered in these threads that need to be brought to light. There will no doubt be things that have got lost in all the other DD that I personally am not aware of (*you don't know what you don't know*). There are likely posts that were good DD a few weeks ago but are now maybe not as true as we thought, maybe things are actually more implicating for those with short positions and this may affect how the information reads as part of a timeline.

**Any/all information you provide on this thread will be read and factored into the timeline, my fellow apes opinions and expertise are valued.** ü¶çü¶ç ü¶ç

&amp;#x200B;

**#2 Reach:**

The further this information gets the better it is for our individual prospects in this stock that we all like so much. Obviously the chances of this being picked up by the mainstream media outlets is low as it directly conflicts what they have been reporting, so **viral exposure on social networks (especially outside of Reddit) are the best places to share this webpage**. *If we can get traction through comments in threads like WSB, WSBN etc that would be great because getting a post passed AutoMod over there is like drawing blood from a stone.* üòÇ

&amp;#x200B;

**Thread Rules:**

\- In the interest of establishing a timeline of real events, please refrain from exclaiming things like **400% SHORT INTEREST** unless you have a statistical justification which stands to reason;

\- Please **don't make assertions that will be difficult to describe concisely** (it's going to be a lot of information anyway so I'm not looking to write a novel for each point/date) - I'll be including a maximum of a few paragraphs per date, *except for significant dates like when they turned the game off because they were losing*;

\- Please **include a relevant date with your post** so that I can tie it into the timeline accordingly;

\- Where possible please **link to data, charts, technical analysis, timelines between events** and anything relevant that happened in-between;

\- Goes without saying but, üöÄüöÄüöÄ posts **are** allowed :), although *useful information* is preferred;",GME,1615127598,infj-t,13,1,True,2021-03-07

We Won,"Some critics and skeptics may murmur their rote-memorized counter-arguments, but that's just the sound of a losing battle playing out in their minds. They're coming to terms with the fact that deep down, this absurd spectacle looks... Pretty fun. Maybe a bit promising. Maybe they can make a quick buck buying dips and selling high, we're all morons to suggest otherwise after all.

As for the skeptics, sure. Some retail holders may need money right this minute, may have dug themselves into a hole they desperately need out of, took out a loan or what have you, and have no choice but to sell insignificant numbers of shares in the grand scheme of things. Or as GME rises out of their price range, they begin to see viable plays in stocks that are dropping in prices. Companies they may never have a chance like this to get in on before our new elite dump their earnings in and fire off smaller rockets all over the marketspace. Personally, my GME Gift shop exit strategy includes at least one bag to hold forever, but I'm bullish on the sentiment that I know how to hustle and at least one Elite Ape is hiring in the near future, and pays better than my current boss. But beyond that....

**NO ONE IS SELLING.**

I have no way of knowing if hedge funds have any more sneaky tricks to kick the can down the road. For all I know that dancing line is a visual representation of Melvin getting punted back and forth by warring Giants while gleeful WSB pros compete with each other to rip as big a chunk of shares out as they can, and will brag and boast and ""grats and Fuck you"" each other a few months down the road while us apes scamper about grabbing tendie crumbs that fall to main streat. Maybe the top tier players skillfully keep the MOASS from launching, I'm never going to care about investment or gambling enough to find out, I thought I was setting a wad of cash on fire because I was mad and heard a funny sea shanty meme.

What's the floor? What's the stock actually worth? I certainly don't know. This is not financial advice but my bias confirms that a GME is worth at least an AMZN some day. So why should I sell?

Well, let me put on my skeptic hat and tell you why.

**Because I haven't spent a month or more walking through hell with you. I just got here. I have no idea who you are. I don't know what a DD is, I have no idea how to navigate this weird website, none of your jokes or lingo make any sense to me. What's a shill, what's a hedge, what's a bot, what's a tendie, what's a reddit?**

Wow that hat was pretty upset, I'm taking it off now. Thanks to our apelike tendency to grab hold of any shiny new thing they see and run rampant with it, then shriek at anyone who tries to take our new toys away, the original meaning of our lingo may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Or old-timers who never listened in the first place. To clarify

**BOT**

A script (Python I believe is most common) that allows one user to fully or semi-automate interaction with Reddit using one or more reddit accounts. Type 69 in a sentence and a bot will likely reply to your comment. ""69? Nice"" users replying ""Good Bot"" or ""Bad Bot"" will summon a bot that maintains scores for bots. There are GOOD bots and there are BAD bots, just like my history is full of GOOD posts and BAD posts. Learning is fun. But they are all piloted by users.

Here are some resources. Also, Bottiquette is a word that is real and that amuses me.

**SHAREHOLDER**

(That's most of us, and hopefully you soon too, friend!)

Someone who has owns a portion of a company. GameStop is yours, you own it. Some of you own so many portions of this company that from where I am, you look like you belong at a desk in an office or something, whereas I'm a loyal fan or something. Or I'm a professional GME sign-spinner, I may have just slipped on my entry level GME dress-code compliant hat. But since this share doesn't currently pay dividends, we own it because we believe it is worth more later than it is now, and disagree with an ever shrinking audience.

SHILL: One who poses as a satisfied customer or an enthusiastic gambler to dupe bystanders into participating in a swindle. How do you know if someone is a shill or not?

You don't and you can't, and we are awesome (and representing our company, hoping to encourage its growth through the sale of either shares or sweet loot from stores), so we assume everyone is honest though possibly confused and lost and in need of direction.

We can very safely assume this because the hedge fund elites who have been a pain our ass for what feels like an eternity are unable to break character. What are they going to do, buy more? Lololol ahem sorry represent company.

Sure, someone may be here to sell you a pump-and-dump because you're a moron. No worries, like I said, lost and confused, and potentially a customer. Show him how intelligent you are with helpful answers to questions, links to DD, or.. I guess just silence? silence is pretty excusable honestly, hard to talk to every single person when you're in the middle of a multi-national rave party, running around talking to people from other sides of the planet. Pick a random person out of the half million subscribers we have, ask them ""hey what's outside?"" Chances are it's like a cool bird or a cityscape or something. Sorry, pump-and-dump guy, I'm very distracted. (Alternatively ask shills for music or something lololo AHEM sorry)

Someone might be using a bot. That's within the rules of the website. Unless they spam, in which case you report them and say please stop spamming. Or they say something rude, then you say derogatory language is against this subs rules and make a joke to show mean words don't hurt your feelings anymore. Or just say bad bot if they're really boring.

There's no more fight! We have won. Let's have fun. If you're scared, say so, a ton of us have been there. Post why you're here! I've been inspired by posts from people who have struggled through more than I ever have, and the fact that they're still moving forward means I can still move forward.

Center stage is very much not my thing and I can feel my composure slipping. I'd much rather spin my GME sign off stage, but let me do my best to larp the higher ups and wrap this up.

Why awareness is more important now than ever,"Disclaimer: English isn't my first language. Sorry if this is a pain to read.

Media suppression, WSB corruption, FUD and shill articles are quite a pain in the ass. As of writing, WSB has 9.4 million members. Of all the posts on the hot page, including the comments, you don't see that much of ""100k minimum"" as seen on this sub. As it has been said many times before, WE set the price, so theoretically 100k is possible (and beyond), however if we want this to actually happen - people must spread the word, and I'm not implying market manipulation (looking at you, interns).

Thanks to Uncle Bruce's newfound popularity amongst retail investors, the fact that he CAN be bought out by HFs and the fact that a large amount of people take his advice and trust what he says, as well as the fact that the majority of people over on WSB are thinking about paperhanding @ 1k, I believe that reaching 100k will be hard. In order for us to achieve a milestone such as this one, the people MUST know that 1k is chump change compared to what is possible. This sub only has 163k members and I don't think that reaching anything above 20k is possible seeing how most of the folks from WSB as well as institutions will most likely be closing positions @ 5k - 10k p/s. Then again, I am not a financial advisor, I have no idea how any of this works, GME go brrr, stock go green, ape get banana.

TL;DR: I believe that [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/) doesn't have the sheer amount of holding power necessary to reach 100k$+. WSB normies will paperhand their shares way earlier which will in turn tank the price and prematurely stagnate the MOASS.

Edit: I am in no way implying that I will be selling at any of the above mentioned price points. I believe in the squeeze as much as any of you. $500k minimum or food stamps.",GME,1615128812,getshankedkid,36,1,True,2021-03-07

Why 100k is not outrageous (for HODLers),"People who consider this number outrageous always assume that every share covered by hedges will be covered at this price. Its highly likely that most shorts will have been margin called by then and covered below 100k, but there will still be some left to cover from the largest institutions with the deepest pockets. So, 100k isnt a meme because people assume that everyone will be able to sell there, which would cost 70 trillion. Rather, most will sell for less than that, freeing up capital for the DTCC and deep-pocketed funds to pay apes what they deserve, upwards of 100k.

Questions on $GME,"My position: 52 shares at average $269

So with the weekend ~~coming up~~ now passed and the usual DD's turning to memes, I instead have some questions I'm hoping apes might be able to answer.

1. **This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!** But this whole thing started when GME was overshorted in the expectation that it was going to go bankrupt.  Couldn't it technically happen again if some other stupid hedge fund(s) decided to overshort some other stock?  Or is there more that I'm missing that led to this perfect storm of GME?
2. **GME shorted stocks with fail-to-delivers.** So my understanding this far is that shorted stocks with fail-to-delivers have x days to find a stock before they \*must\* deliver.  However, no such thing is happening   Leading some to believe that hedge funds are simply shorting more stock to make up for the shorted fail-to-delivers.  Are we essentially waiting on someone to recall the stocks or for someone to say ""hey these are a lot of shorted stocks"" and demand the shorts to pay up?  Or what are we waiting on to happen (the ""trigger"" for the rocket, as it were)?
3. **Stock purchasing when there's no more stocks to give.**  So the stocks are shorted to shit and back, yet people keep buying them.  Are we saying that there's no flag in the system somewhere that says ""no more stocks to give""?  That, technically speaking, people could continue buying stocks even if there are no more of a particular stock, driving the price up of any stock to infinity?
4. **Finra ownership**.  So there were DD's earlier posting equity ownership in GME from FINRA.  Now I have a ROTH IRA with Fidelity where my stocks are owned, where would that show up?  Would it be listed under Fidelity, or would I show up as an individual investor?
5. **Retail is in control vs just along for the ride.**  I've seen this one go back and forth multiple times and I'm not sure which one to believe anymore.  Is retail currently in control of the price to hold forever or could we get fucked over by some company deciding to sell millions of shares at some peak, ensuring that the rocket comes crashing down around us?

I've had this sitting in drafts for 2 days now in case I came up with any other questions, but most of them would usually get answered by some other post XD

Their greatest fear is not losing money,"These people are so beyond rich, it won't matter much, especially since they have come ahead and squirreled away their assets in fake divorces, gifts to kids and packaged the upcoming losses in neat little shell companies. Sure one or two majors are going down, but only the people on the lower rungs of the ladders there will be materially affected.

Their greatest fear is not that. Certainly not legal consequences either, America is a true Banana Republic where money gets you out of anything. 

What they are actually afraid of is what peasants like us might do with millions. They are afraid of a tidal wave of philanthropic endeavours beyond 0.00034% of ones net worth. They are afraid of millionaires and billionaires happily paying taxes to give back to their communities and absolutely worst of all: freeing up time and resources to get politically active, involved and heard. 

Can you imagine? People with almost equal financial pull suddenly working to close those gaps and loopholes? People with money actually working towards fair wages, social programs for all, rehabilitation instead of punishment, decriminalization of drugs, free education and worst of all: an actual fair start to everyone as best as possible? 

You need go realize that money is more than yachts and houses and paying off pornstars to keep quiet about your shortcomings. 

Money will give you time and your words weight to add to a political discourse. They are scared out of their minds because each and everyone of us is heading towards freedom from wage slavery and modern serfdom. This, from their perspective, is a slave rebellion.

Once you have status, time and freedom, you can tirelessly work towards the change the world needs. Get active on climate change, workers rights, education, health care, social programs, demilitarization of police, research, international cooperation, changes to the legal and political system to root out corruption and hardening then against future attacks. 

Don't stop at looking out for your friends and family financially. The absolute most empowering result of the GME Moass will be a sudden influx of highly educated, motivated, idealistic, YOUNG professionals entering the political discourse in earnest. 

The most valuable asset you will gain from your gains will be your time and the freedom to use it for the benefit of others. 

This has the same political potential as emancipation.

Pick a topic, any topic, and donate some of your newfound freedom to coming generations by getting politically active for the betterment of all. Don't just hope your financial donations will be all that is needed. Charitable organizations have been around for a very long time. And while they do a lot of good, mostly they treat symptoms and are incapable to address the causes that make them necessary. You however will be able to go out and change what needs go be changed.

In the past you can find direct correlations between short interest rising and some coordinated drops.  I don't see a ton of sell volume and I'm noticing they are doing it when the SPY/Other Index's drop. I find that interesting.  

Anyone have any ideas besides they were sitting on shorts until today?  I'm just trying to figure out how they lowered the price at times without a large increase of short interest, unless an institution sold off or some retail shake out.  I'm now looking at the options chain changes, anyone want to join in to help solve this mystery to me?

The mother of all pinches???,"Apes, I need to know how badly i have fucked up and I cant reach anyone at robinhood.

So about a month ago i heard about the mini squeeze and became convinced it hadnt squoze, so i set up an account and started buying the stock. I used the instant transfers, not realizing it meant i was buying on margin. I bought shares on 2/3, 2/4, 2/16. 2/22. 2/23 and 2/26, thinking i was buying stock and not the ability to potentially issue options. I was more preoccupied with trying to understand how the squeeze worked than to consider wtf i may actually be setting myself up for.

So yesterday, I decided to sell some shares to try to get a better car (i drive a real beater). I put up 23 in a stop limit trade at $125, with a limit price of 800. I know NOW that this was an options trade(edit: most likely it wasnt) and not just a form of sell order or something.  Well 4 of those shares got ""purchased"", but I changed my mind and decided to HOLD until the moass and cancelled the trade before the end of the trading day. I still had my shares and thought nothing of it. Today on the option chart I noticed there are 40 contracts written at the 43.50 level for 800, even tho I cancelled the trade. 

I started to really panic here because I remembered some things from studying the 29 crash in finance class in college. NEVER buy on margin, etc.

So today, I thought i'd fix things by selling my shares at a price level that would cover the spread of the contract costs. It would wipe out my gains, but i'd be clear, i thought.

I went to the bank to deposit funds so that RH would stop holding last cash transfer (bank said it landed today, RH has it expiring friday) and downgrade my account to a cash account. And while I was there I explained the situation to the manager. He said that stocks bought on margin have the ability to assign options, which I didnt know. And he told me that I should not have sold the shares to cover the contract, because now whoever owns them can issue more options in my name that i would be responsible for. This scared the shit out of me because I have been thinking about the scale of the moass for the last couple weeks.

HOW FUCKING DEEP am I in here? Do they really let beginner investors assign options? I didnt know i was selling options, i thought i was selling the stock at a markup and taking a few of those calls down at the 800 level. 

Can a big brain ape explain to me if I am going to be the one holding the biggest bag of all time? Can I go to prison for any of this? If so, I'll try to post the loss porn before the cart me away. But for now, I need some help and answers.... and no one picks up on RH support.

Was I really issuing options for these stocks with a RH novice level account?  Can I be liable for potentially billions in losses? RH is still holding my account hostage since they claim the last transfer doesnt land til friday but my bank showed that it hit today.  Can anyone save me from myself at this point or am I doomed?

TLDR:  I bought shares thru February on a margin account without realizing it.  The options on these all expired on 2/27 if I understand correctly. The largest chunk was 23 shares at $43.5. (Bruce briefly mentioned something about $43 calls in a video on 3/27 and seemed hyped by them: https://youtu.be/VwXLRoAw3Z4?t=707 )  I sold them today while still on a margin account because i thought i had to fulfill an order that i'd placed and cancelled for some of those $800 calls.  I learned that in order to switch my account to cash basis, I had to make a deposit to bring my balance up.  While at the bank, I spoke with the bank manager about the situation and he stated that I shouldnt have sold those shares because if they were still on margin, that meant that whoever owned them could issue options that I would be potentially liable for.  Am I in a situation where the massive losses this thing generates end up getting dumped on me? I didn't sell the shares, but it appears a bunch of naked shorts were generated from them.  I tried to throw them in front of a buy side spike so at least the good guys have them if the situation is in fact TRULY fucked.  Take care of me on the flipside.

TO ALL WHO HAVE STUDENT LOANS AND MORTGAGES: Paying them off is not always the right call.,"Before I go into this, this all depends on your personal financial situation. I am a recently Graduated accountant, so I actually know what I'm talking about when it comes to this stuff.

I know a lot of us are really excited to pay off our mortgages and student loans, but make sure to do the math on your interest rates before paying them off right away. I'm going to use my own numbers for this example, but this applies to any loans that you would have. I know a lot of people hate having loans and their immediate reaction to having extra money is to pay off any debts that you have. In some cases, such as credit card debt, this is definitely the right case. When it comes to longer term debts, such as student loans and mortgages, this isn't always the case. It's time to start thinking like the rich, and this is how they save their money better than we do.

The debt: I have 43 000 $ CAD in student. loans at a variable interest rate of prime + 1%. Prime right now is 2.45%, so I have an annual interest rate of 3.45%. Now of course this will go up and down depending on the prime, but we're going to go with that. Paying it off over 15 years (314$ a month, the bare minimum), it will cost me 11 234 $ in interest. That's a lot of money, and our first impulse is to think we want to pay off the debt to save all that interest. 

Total cost of debt including Premium: 43 000 + 11 234  = **54 234 $**

BUT!

What if you decide you aren't going to pay off the debt right away, continue to pay the interest, and invest the money in the market instead.  Let's say you get a 5 % return on the stock market annually. This is a low estimate of course, but I don't want to start throwing big numbers around. 

Compounded annually, over 15 years, at 5%, your 43 000 $ will turn into **89 394 $.** 

This will leave you with a net profit over 15 years of **34 160 $**. This isn't even taking into considered future contributions to your investments over the years. Which I plan on doing anyway because I'm only paying the minimum on my student loans. The same concept applies to your mortgage. 

If anyone is interested in similar examples applied to a mortgage, as well as the potential benefit of only paying the minimum on your student loan and investing the rest, please comment on PM me and I can give out other money management examples that might apply better to your situation. 

I know a lot of the people on this thread are new to investment and might be using this as a shot at paying off your debts and I really want to help you all maximize the potential gains that you can make from the squeeze. I encourage you to ask any questions!",GME,1614699832,sgtmattie,35,1,True,2021-03-02

Remember that the best thing you can do is to become an informed trader.,"Start watching technical analysis on YouTube and learning about it online. Learn about candlesticks, including bullish and bearish formations. Go to a real broker or trading website and start analyzing charts over customized time-frames instead of watching the shitty ass graph that Robinhood gives you (I know most of you mfs are still using it, don't lie). 

I recommend ""Think or Swim."" You can also use other platforms like Trading View. They allow you to draw your own trendlines, save them, and customize your time frames. It will help you stay calm and make informed, objective decisions in your trading. Informed retail traders are the biggest threat to hedge funds at this time.

"For all the newcomers, please show us you have üíé üôå like the rest of this sub. All this talk about sell price and squeeze dates makes it look like you MIGHT waver when things look bad. Remember, we literally held through a month of red. And that holding is what got us to where we are now","I got in high at 300+ and I bought on the way down. 230, 130, 100, 90, 60, back up at 80, a bunch at 50, and around 40

But then I slowed down and I'm so mad I didn't buy more when it was in the 40s. I gotta admit, by that time, they had really beaten me down. I started to doubt myself. But every day, there was something on this sub that would bring my confidence back

&amp;#x200B;

Then about a week ago I watched it climb. I almost jizzed when it broke 54, can you imagine how I felt during after hours? It hit about 185 and I know a lot of people decided to join the game the next day. But you might be thinking it jumped from 40 to 185 before you got in and now it's not doing much. Just hovering, no big gains üòî Well get that thought out of your head and remember what came before the spike. DIAMON FUCKING HANDS. WE HELD  


So use our diamond balls as an example. We held and it paid off. But that little spike was nothing. Holding is the fuel for this rocket. Are you gonna fill up the tank? Or are you gonna take some with you for your escape pod and watch us from Earth while diamond hands fly past the moon? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you where I'm at. I like this fucking stock. A lot. I love it. I don't care if they bring the price back down to 40. I actually hope they do so I can fix my mistake of not buying more at that price. Squeeze or not, through all the FUD, through the red days, past the DD target dates, I'm holding.

Prediction for 3/2 Volume,"Today's volume will land between 35 - 40 million. Tomorrow will be 45 - 55 million. 

No major price movement will happen today. Expect price to stay under 130 and above 115.
The major battles from now on will happen on Friday, with Thursday playing a key role to set up Fridays. Mondays will see a fair amount of movement as well due to settlements from Fridays. 

The play for shorts is to continuously try to knock down the price down 7-8% per day to avoid triggering that 10% breaker. 7-8% drop is not enough to cause paper hands, so they will let the price run up to $125 - $130 and then short it down to $110 - $115 hoping to scare some paper hands, just slowly chipping away at the shares they need. 


The play for (institutional) longs is to keep the price even for today and tomorrow. They will want to keep the price around this point to make it easier to cause a 10% drop to trigger the SSR restriction list.

Here we go! $130!,"Gamestop jumped to $130! The Shorts are losing the battle!

On Friday, GME closed at $101 forcing options contracts to both expire and hit that strike price. This forces options to buy or sell - but they have three days to settle. Today is the last day to settle. Hedges are deciding if they can still risk it for the biscuit. If they don't do something or get a good price, they have to buy at market value. Sort of like a new york landlord forcing you to pay rent at gun point. 

My belief and opinion is that tomorrow will be insane and today's closing will also be crazy. The short have a pain threshold. Once crossed, they're spirit is broken and we go to the moon...

Make suggestions and I'll make some additions. Which iconic songs or GME meme videos am I missing? (I will make an actual playlist)",GME,1614453308,Stevebee420,16,9,True,2021-02-27

No Ape Left Behind: A Government Exit Strategy,"**A speculative look at what might happen if we do go to 'the moon' and a proposal for a Governmental exit strategy.**

Note: *This is not intended to be DD, it only looks at one possible scenario.*

Imagine we wake up one day to find GME is unquestionably and unstoppably on the way to the moon. For whatever squeezy reason we're seeing a constant loop of 10% gains and 5 minute halts. Paper handing isn't even possible because hedge fund algorithms are jumping in within milliseconds, triggering the next halt before retail even gets to see a sell button.

What happens next? Well, assuming a start point of $100 per share and that there are no other mechanisms for halting (we should DD that), we hit $100k (the common WSB figure for 'the moon') remarkably quickly. After 1 hour we are at $285. We pass $1000 at 2 hours 10 minutes, and it really starts compounding quickly. After just 6 hours 10 minutes we are 'on the moon' at $105k and when the 6.5 hour trading day ends the market closes (after triggering the 'within 15m of end of day' longer halt) at $127,189.53 per share.

First, the good news. If you have at least 8 shares, you are now *in theory* a millionaire. If DFV still has 100k shares, his gain today is 12.7 billion dollars, nice but not economy-breaking. Fidelity on the other hand, who had 272 times more shares than DFV at last count therefore finish the day with an asset value approaching that of the entire world economy... but we're only just getting started on how broken things now are, buckle up because things are about to get seriously weird. Aftermarkets don't halt so the price becomes effectively infinite. Markets worldwide fall over because every financial institution in the world is either broke or infinitely wealthy and a lot of them can't even work out which group they are in because the numbers are too big and their system crashed. 

**Oops**

I think we can safely say that the markets do not open the next day.

Retail has a problem: If there *is* a way out of this mess, GME holders not *all* going to be able to sell before the price drops, and many have diversified portfolios that now contain a lot of smoking holes in the ground.

The US Government clearly has to step in, but what can they do? They need a solution that fixes everything fast, without letting down a *lot* of people who played by the rules and won (you may recall that Yahoo Finance reported that 28% of Americans bought viral stocks). Bailing out institutions simply won't work, because most are *infinitely* broke. They need to fix two big issues here, firstly that demand for GME shares would still be still infinite if left unchecked and secondly that WSB has proved that crashing everything is possible. If a bunch of amateurs can do it almost by mistake, China and Russia would both have bot armies doing this every few days from now on. They need a fix and they need it fast.

**Luckily, it's *really* simple to fix all this!**

1) To fix the institutions, roll back to last night's backup and suspend trading in meme stocks and meme stock options.

2) To solve the regulatory problem, Blame the DTCC, nationalise it, and give it 2 jobs: Keeping short interest down to safe levels and mopping up the rest of the institutional issues.

3) What to do about WSB: Give *every* retail investor 100k per share, from DTCC's assets and (if necessary) future revenue.

I know some of us were shooting for $150k or more, but we're reasonable people and if there was a scenario where the price hit 100k without breaking the world financial system I like to think those of us who sold at 100k or more would be sharing our gains with other diamond hands who ended up bag holders. This deal would not only save us the trouble of setting all that up but we get to be actually rich in a world with a functioning economy rather than rich on paper in world entirely owned and ruled by Fidelity Asset Management.

**Here's the good news**

This actually *solves* a lot of America's problems, and gives the US economy a huge boost for free. 

How? Well firstly, inequality: The 1% are now the 29%, and includes a lot of people who are not going to devote their lives to getting richer at everyone else's expense. 

Secondly, the Government gets a financial transaction tax for free, with no legislation needed, because it's entitled to the DTCC's profits. 

Thirdly (and this is the big one!) WSB people will pay their taxes. We don't do all that offshoring stuff, so 20% of the money will flow back to the government in capital gains tax, giving the government a revenue boost of somewhere around a trillion dollars.


**TLDR**; 100k isn't a meme, but it probably breaks the world economy. Luckily the fix turns out to be really good all round.

What‚Äôs your 1 share really worth?,"Been seeing a lot of FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) about people who don‚Äôt have a ton of shares. I personally don‚Äôt feel like I have that many myself. But what is the value or impact of your 1 share. The best way I could think of it is through this analogy. 

Imagine being in a completely dark space. Like absolute zero light. You can‚Äôt see your hand in front of your face.  Now image that same space being freezing cold. Like -100. So cold you won‚Äôt survive 30 seconds. 

So what‚Äôs your weapon for protection. You have 1 match (1 share). You light this match and it lasts 30 seconds adding seconds to your life and it‚Äôs done. And you‚Äôre done. That‚Äôs it that what your one share is worth. 

Now imagine not 1 of you but hundreds and thousands of us with that match. Now we got something here. We can see around us we get some heat. We have people with birthday candles (25-100 shares) we have people with house candles (100-500 shares) we have flame throwers and so on. That one match can light our candles. 

In the our community and our collective 1 share doesn‚Äôt mean anything alone. Just like your 1,000 shares don‚Äôt mean anything. Just like your 10,000 shares don‚Äôt mean anything. 

But our millions of collective shares certainly mean something. They‚Äôre trying to freeze us out. We gotta keep each other going. Hold your shares. I‚Äôll hold mine and we have to continue to trust we will continue to support and protect one another. 

Remember the three guarantees in life. Death. Taxes. And all shorts must cover.

Important: Don't set a limit order when the rocket is taking off! Use stop losses when it has passed your price target.,"If you set a limit order, you limit how high the price can go for you and others. Set a stop loss once it has passed your price target so you can still ride the rocket up!

Once it passes your price target, set a stop loss for that or higher depending on how quickly it moves. Even better, you can keep adjusting your stop loss and move it higher and higher as the stock price moves higher and higher.

Don't put a ceiling on yourself or the rocket, instead, keep moving the floor higher and higher.

Edit: I have no idea how far from the price you should set a stop at. If you can do a trailing stop loss (that is not a specific price, but a percentage drop from the current price) that would be easier and probably better, but my broker doesn't offer that. The higher it goes, the bigger the swings could be. Could swing $100's $1000's, even $10,000s on its way up. 

Edit 2: I will be setting stop losses as the price rises above my target price, and I'll keep adjusting it as it goes up, but I will probably only do it for some of my shares so I still keep some skin in the game incase there are wild swings but the stock continues to go up.

Edit 3: after discussing with counter arguments in this post, I'd like to revise my opinion. Ideally, you don't set any stop loss or sell limit. But probable only if you can watch the ticker all day. Stop losses and sell limits are for people who can't watch it. But possibly even better, just set price alerts and make the decision to sell on your own.",GME,1614455229,rick_rolled_you,69,128,True,2021-02-27

Index Funds selling in the market crash and GME short squeeze,"So, i dunno who all say this post on wsb

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lteecj/gme_may_have_the_potential_to_dictate_the_course/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

It showed that DJIA is negatively correlated to GME at least since Jan 1. So there are two theories for this. First the prevalent one:

When GME rises, short hedgies portfolio goes more red and they have to raise money to maintain their credit and hence they sell Other stocks that they actually own. 

But, here is another theory (which i have written about before) but i will repeat it here. For this u have to realize how shorting to such large quantities work. The shorts have to borrow millions of shares to short. Where are they getting these shares? The index funds like Russell which has GME as a component are the ones that lend shares. Every 401k and pension funds has shit load of these index funds and hence shit load of gme shares.  Now, these index fund managers do not care if their underlying components go up or down. They are just supposed to perform as good as the index which they do regardless of whether their actions cause some components to go up or down.  So, the main source of shares (which we constantly read about ‚Äúshares to borrow‚Äù come from index funds owned by pension and 401k funds.  There are other sources too, but they are tiny. 

Ok, when market starts crashing, people move money out of stocks and into cash or bonds. This includes en masse selling of index funds. So index  fund managers have to sell the components in that index. But, wait? Didnt they already loan out their GME component? So how can they sell? Well they can sell as their broker dealer will sell it on their behalf with a ‚Äúfailure to deliver ‚Äú mark on that stock to whoever bought it in this sale. But, this FTD has to be corrected in the 2-3 days. So, the shorties get a recall notice or they have to borrow from somewhere else. Basically, number of shares available to short drops and the interest rate spikes. This causes a spike in GME. 

Tldr: gme rising causes market crash by first theory, and market crash cause gme to rise by second theory. So we get squeeze squared.

We don't sell here. But you do want to make sure your shares are not being lent out for shorting.

I got a real hair up my ass about this because of the discussions about margin vs cash accounts and here's what I found after digging through my Cuck'inHood statements:

#NO MATTER IF YOU ARE GREEN OR GOLD YOUR SHARES ARE HELD IN MARGIN. IT'S ON YOUR STATEMENT. IT'S NOT WORTH DEBATING.

I transferred most of my shares to Fidelity starting this past Tuesday at 8:00AM, about 200 out of 250. I did this because those were the shares that I knew I bought a month ago and the funds had settled on. The rest of them (realistically it's like 30) I'm holding on RH for a couple of days before I send more over to Fidelity.

My transfer was reviewed by Fidelity the same day, and Robinhood cleared the next day, Wednesday. 

#BY THIS TIME

Fidelity did not have a margin agreement with me yet, so they could not convert my shares from margin to cash, however by Friday I was able to.

#GET ON THE CHAT, NOT THE CALL LINE.

Fuck phones, what sort of smooth-brained boomer fuck uses that anymore other than for sex lines and to order shit off of HGTV? 

Do it at work. The fuck is your boss going to say? Your 401(k) is probably through them anyway and the chat queue for me was like 200. Took an hour to sit through and you want to watch the window but it is worth it. 

The screenshot I posted yesterday is when I had already had my shares converted to cash, but I missed the chat, they just got my message- I had Taco Bell for lunch and had to take a huge shit- but it confirms Fidelity's TOC. They will not lend your shares for shorting. 

#AND NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN: YOU WANT THAT SHORT INTEREST ON TOP OF YOUR TENDIES, YOU GREEDY CUNT-MUFFIN

IDK about RobinHood because their customer service is like trying to get in touch with a WoW server admin pre-Lich King, but any other broker that's worth a shit can recall your shares if they are being lent. Go read the Dr. Burry AMA on this. 

TL;DR: Make sure your shares are not in fact being held in margin as this more safely secures your shares from being shorted.

I'll post this here though about shorting ETF's.

With regular stocks, the investor would not be able to enter into the position if the downward pressure was great**. ""

I recommend reading this DD:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found\_the\_reason\_for\_the\_dip\_they\_are\_shorting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found_the_reason_for_the_dip_they_are_shorting/)

I'm watching live.  They did the homework.

**Edit (2:30PM):**  I'm following Level 2's for XRT, IJS, VTWV, AMC and GME. What I'm seeing is they are coordinating across all these ETF's mass drops to try to shake out retail and defend $150.

Anyone of them being shorted with coordination is causing the exact drops across all short ETF's and GME on the charts. I'm following the 5 mins on all them. Like they are exact matches. Downward pressure on any of them directly effects GME.

They shorted 1.5 million GME yesterday and now all these ETF's so assume another million or 2 across the ETF's.

**Edit 2 (2:54PM)**  \-  So that buy spike came from XRT and GME.  Someone dropped about 60k shares buy on XRT and 1.5 Million Buy on GME.  Immediately shorted and pushed down under $150.

**Edit 3 (3:35PM) -**  They are going for it.  I'm impressed.  They need this to work.  If not, they are fucked in many ways since now they are bleeding off profitable things to keep this afloat.  XRT this morning was up like $4 bucks and now its down $3  so a $7 swing on an ETF which in a non crash, is not normal.  They just keep shorting it so I'm just going to keep buying.    


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*Just a reminder:  there is a reason for this urgency on their part.  It's expensive for them to keep shorts going and it gets more expensive the higher they go.  They have to pay more interest.  Second reason for urgency, Stimmy and tax refunds are coming.  They don't need Apes to get like thousands of dollars in Stimmy/Refund money and yolo them on GME shares.    


I believe the Shorts to be using some Game Theory.  They acquired the extra short positions and then used them in mass drops.  \* You woke up excited. Couldn't wait for the bell....this is it.  Boom They drop the hammer on us.  They defend $150 against some whales midday, they let it creep up long enough for some to close their options at 150 and 160 then boom drop it HARD.  Then you think we will go up into close, BOOM.....they SMACK it down hard.  It's going to drop into the 90s and 80s going into tomorrow.   


Did you miss out.  FUD coming in.  Did we mess that up?  Was that the Gamma Squeeze?  Did we miss out again.....?  You start doubting yourself.  Maybe I should just get out.... STOP.  You do what you want to do but I'm buying more.  

That's exactly what they want.  This stock was at 40 bucks like 2 days ago and now it's 100.  That's not a bad thing.  Plus, we know they now that they tripled and quadrupled down on it.  That to me smells of desperation.

My dad raises a point: Does anybody have a theory for possible Hedgefund exit strategies?,"My dad plans to go paperhands at a limit well below what people here talk about. He's not in it for a cause and doesn't believe it's the once-in-a-lifetime situation we think it is. His reasoning basically boils down to the idea that risk-management people at hedge funds would have a killer counter-strategy which would prevent the price from rising in the kind of infinite-price Short Squeeze we've been discussing.  
So the question then becomes one that is as largely theoretical as our maximum ROI on this trade:  
If you were in the position we think the Hedge funds are now in, what could you possibly be counting on to save your skin?   
What moves could you make to get yourself out of this situation?  


I've seen some people on here suggesting that Ken Griffin and others might try to smuggle a few hundred millions out of the country and move somewhere the US doesn't have an extradition treaty with. This seems like a fairly obvious option that would always be on the table for anybody in that game as the nuclear-option final-exit-strategy.  
I've seen some people suggest that a cabal of insiders might make moves which restrict trading, but lacking either an actual description of the mechanism they could use to do that or evidence to suggest they have the means available to act on it, I don't see a reason to favor that hypothesis. In fact, since I don't even know of any mechanism which could potentially do that, I only bring up this hypothesis in order to point out where the glaring gaps in my own knowledge are.

The last suggestion I've seen made was that the government might intervene. Personally, I doubt that the US government could act quickly enough or decisively enough to prevent the squeeze from happening, so I'm putting this one down as possible, but extremely unlikely. I don't know of too many Government actions which averted fiscal crises, only ones that went in to affect afterwards.  


Let me know what you think, I don't have much more to go on. I like the stock and am still holding, but my dad is not a typically unreasonable person; the only countervailing consideration is that I think he might be allowing his experience to bias him against the possibility of being in on the upside of a black-swan event.

My prediction for Feb 25th - Afternoon surprise?,"I'm a dumb ape. Don't take financial advice from a dumb ape. 

Yesterday a whale came and bought a ton of stock. That led to a wild rise from 42 at open to 91 at close, and a high of $200 after hours. 

Predictably, the stock dropped (revenge of the hedges) when market opened this morning, and then started it's afternoon climb. 

We're seeing the start of a Gamma Short. This whale that took on the hedges yesterday wouldn't randomly just drop money and walk away. I think tomorrow call options are due and that'll drive up the price. However, for today, I wonder if in twenty minutes, we'll see the whale come in again. 

Like, pretend you aren't an ape. You're a whale. You don't just buy the stock like us simple apes. You know the hedges are going to short you. You need to break their spirit by forcing them to short to try and cover losses from apes, and then splash in again for the next two days. 

So yesterday we saw a splash, I suspect a splash could help us apes today, and maybe tomorrow one more splash just to break the spirit of the hedges. 

What do you think? Do you think our whale investor is going to jump in again today, crippling hedges? Or is $175 our ceiling?",GME,1614280539,grogosaur83,16,14,True,2021-02-25

I'd be fine being called the enemy ruining the market if the hedge funds lose.,"We all know what's been go ining on this last month and especially today. Unless your new here than you need to know what's been happening, you've probably seen posts around so you probably understand a little bit by now. 

They've...

 Cheated the market using any means they can, even having to pay fines to avoid this squeeze.

Turned news media against retail investors for manipulating market (we just like the stock so screw that)

Tried to Manipulate our hands, they thought we had paper hands, they didn't realize those guys left a while ago.

Possibly lied in the court hearing, I'm sure they had lawyers giving them the most twisty words that would squeeze them out of that. Also nobody cares about your bulgarian story Robinhood!! (Don't mean to offend bulgarians but I'd like to know how he manipulated the market)

Attacked our good ape DFV because he saw it was shorted and thought it was undervalued.

Claimed to have a hard corona life when they still made billions, how do you complain about that??? This is more of a meme but seriously too...

Could have cheated market by paying the CFO to tank GameStop and that's why they originally shorted GME, this is more speculation and they could have realized he just doesn't know how to run a company.

Shorted GameStop in so many different ways this last month through ETFs, these guys don't know when to quit man. They might literally stake all their money just so they don't lose to retail. Little more insight, if you lost to the worst players in a video game you would be embarrassed, however these guys would rather lose it all to make sure they don't lose. **Imagine Ninja yelling to that little kid in in h1z1 battle royale** after he killed the kid.

"Diamond hands, food for thought.","There has been a lot of talk about certain price points as exit strategies and just wanted to bring up a certain thought process. 

Everyone thinks that a squeeze will happen in the bull market, but wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense for HF to stockpile cash by liquidating other positions in order to cover their shorts?

Everyone says ‚Äúthey can stop trading, they can create false share through ETFs‚Äù whats to stop them from taking 100s of billions of dollars off of the table, and creating REAL weakness and paper hands in the market.  

There‚Äôs been talk about the system collapsing because of this, but the system collapsing could be prior as well.

Can you still Diamond hands when the DJIA just dropped past 25k and no slowing down in sight?

ITS SO COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT IF THIS HAPPENS BUY AND HOLD THE DIP.

If you celebrate green or dread red days you dont know what a shortsqueeze is and that's a problem.,"Reminder retards. During a shortsqueeze the daily stock value isnt an important or interesting metric.

&amp;#x200B;

The interesting metrics are: - Volume (should be low on down spikes) - Short interest - Short vs float - Short percentage - Catalysts that provoke a need to cover and other such indicators of scarcity of stock supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing else matters. **The importance of the pricepoint between now and the squeeze is seriously almost ZERO. Green days dont matter, nor do reds.**

&amp;#x200B;

I know you smooth brains are used to looking at ""green good"" ""red bad"" AND that you all have the attention spans of hamsters which makes you question valid DD because ""why no print money yet, boring"" but with volume so low and so little circulation its easy to make the line do funny things.

&amp;#x200B;

Know the DD, and know what a fucking shortsqueeze is and how it works before you panic about nothing. Its actually dangerous being uninformed. It leads you to make poor (financial) decisions, opens you up to being receptive to misinformation and unintentionally makes you have a bad effect on the mindset of others that are also less than optimally informed.

&amp;#x200B;

**During or leading up to the point of a shortsqueeze it is NOT buying that gets the price up like in normal market situations. So dont focus on it**

&amp;#x200B;

- Dont beg for whales to come help buy.

- Dont beg DFV to post (for some reason?!)

- Dont look at red numbers and doubt the underlying DD that you did before investing (Right? RIGHT?)

- Dont overcelebrate green moments or days like Jesus' second coming.

&amp;#x200B;

**The moonshot in a shortsqueeze situation comes from endless demand impulse when shorts are required to cover, combined with unavailability of shares to do so with because theyre owned by shareholders. This means that holding a certain percentage suffices, although increasing also increases pressure and squeeze leverage.**

&amp;#x200B;

In such a situation a bullshit instant gratification attitude would be bad. I encourage everyone who has invested or is planning to actually read up on what a shortsqueeze is because otherwise you'd falsely assume everyone is just randomly shouting ""hold"" and ""it will come"".

My boomer Sugar Daddy acting like a shill IRL,"Pos: 311 @ 150

I went all in YOLO because I did my research and found that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. My sugar daddy caught on and he was all for it, he even matched what I put down just before the rocket got stopped late January.

He was telling me to sell at 400... I told him no way and I am holding with my fellow apes because this is nothing compared to what we can have. He would laugh at me and call me crazy, tell me that no one else is thinking of each other. No one else is thinking of me, so I should do what's best for me. Now I try telling him that generally that's how stock markets go, but this is different... This is the potential of wealth redistribution. And I am all for that.

Growing up my parents were Soviet refugees and slaved away to try to make a living. Childhood was tough. Everything I have now is because I fought tooth and nail for it. There are so many stories about apes with similar pasts, difficult lives and I just think, why should the hedge funds win?

Anyway I digress. My sugar daddy kept telling me the price will go back to 3 dollars because the squeeze squoze. Kept telling me the hedge funds did cover. Kept saying we should cut our losses. Also that as soon as the price hits 300 he is taking his money out.

I had to have a serious talk with him yesterday and I told him that we will break up if he keeps acting like a shill. He falls for boomer tactics because he is a boomer. I told him to have a little patience and have some faith. He also doesn't understand the importance of why apes have blind faith in each other, as a decentralised retail fund. We give each other vetted DD and can piece together things that hedge funds alone can't. 

Now in the future I know I want to date someone who went all in on GME and didn't pull out before 10k. That kind of guy will be the love of my life.

Thanks for listening retards, IANAFA and I am not just holding for myself... I am holding for you. I love you all.

Here's hoping this post won't get removed again.  
Schwab currently lists the available qty for borrow as 'limited' in their platform.

I called in to verify the exact quantity.  
***Schwab states there are approximately 400K shares available to short.***  
***I called in last week and that amount was ZERO!***

Also, I wanted to confirm the exact margin requirement for GME.I do recall getting a message that this was 300% directly from Schwab a few weeks back.

"Not really sure about this, but I'm wondering if they're gonna try to pump AMC before GME takes off, so that they can get some more paper hands to sell GME and chase the AMC hype.","I haven't been looking much into AMC, because I think GME is the play here. I did buy a few shares weeks ago that I've been sitting on, but otherwise I've gone all in on GME and I've been keeping up with all the new DD.

AMC may well squeeze again, but I don't think it would be comparable to GME. In fact, I kinda think AMC is just a distraction. A distraction which could pay out, sure.. But GME feels like the big play here.

If they pump AMC while GME stays pretty much where it's at, they may be able to shake out some more paper hands to chase the AMC hype.

Now like I said, my attention has been focused on GME. I could very well be wrong, and I welcome anyone who wants to correct me. I'm still holding my AMC and will continue to do so, but I won't be chasing it if it takes off. Instead, my plan is to sell at a good price and to get more GME from it.

AMC is likely still a good play at the current price, especially long-term, but I still think it's a distraction.. And a good one at that. If anyone has any thoughts on that, please let me know. This week has been very telling for GME and I'm very excited for the near future.

Some serious questions,"So you guys are holding tight to your shares which makes me proud. But there is some stuff that is russeling my jimmies. 
1. ok everyone is holding so far so good
2. if someone steals money from you on the street, would you just sit there and wait that he will give it back or would you at least go to the police and report it? 
Assuming you are deciding for the later: so you have been robbed now in bright daylight by the HF and I can see very few people doing anything about it. 
I think a few things should be done:
3. A: taking serious social media action, targeting politicians and influencers to make the Story available for the broad mass ( the mainstream media is probably bought by the HF, or they have no clue what they are talking about) 

B: organizing protests, I mean people are protesting for every dumb shit, why not for a good cause too?

C: download the GameStop app, follow every channel they have

D: reach out for Papa Cohen, he can‚Äôt stay silent so long with so many millions hoping for a sign of him.

F: research companies/ people who were fu**ed by Hf in the past and tell them they have the change to stick it back to them now

"Block the Sneak Attack! Buy, Hold &amp; VOTE! Recall your shares!","It's been a slow week for DD. And many have done great on the short numbers, which I can't, so I thought I'd look at this squeeze from a governance angle with the Annual General meeting approaching.

**TL;DR:** learn your rights to vote and own your shares with your broker. Some of info below is not new, and some of the info is, but all is definitely worth knowing. Linked articles are very, very long. You can vote by proxy/mail. Votes can block a sneak attack by HFS at annual meeting. Long papers indicate HF strategies they may be using.

**DD:** The more I learn about GME, the more I like. I bought, I held. And now I really want to be a part of the company long term, so I am going to vote. I expect many of you are like me, We Like the Stock!  I am recalling my shares so I can vote - here is why!

Many brokers automatically lend shares that shareholders have bought. Shareholders may not even know their shares can, and have been loaned, and that they are a lender. Shareholders can find out from their broker. I care about GME and my investment so I am recalling my shares so I can vote immediately.

# Borrowed Shares Can Swing Company Votes

There is a darker side to lending shares.  Private investment firms, like Hedge Funds, can manipulate a company's future by ""borrowing shares, then voting against decisions that are good for the company, intentionally causing the companies to fail! Called ""Empty Voting"". They literally accumulate votes, attend the annual meeting, and vote against good ideas. This could be an important battle as GameStops management fights to turn the company around. This may or may not be in play for GME, but it can be removed as an option by recalling your voting shares.

# Recalling Shares

I have seen so many posts asking for GameStop management to recall the shares. And asking why haven't they done it yet.  Anyone wanting to retain their voting rights can do it themselves via their broker, and do it whenever they want, for whatever reason they want!

Any shareholder owing Class A shares is eligible to vote (see above as to why owning voting rights is important). But to do so, shares must be ‚Äúowned‚Äù **AND** they must not be lent out. If the broker has lent them to someone else, say a HF to short sell, the benefitting shareholder cannot vote. To vote, shares must be recalled into ownership by the ""record date"" the company sets before its annual general meeting. Last year this date was April 20, 2020.

If shareholders purchased shares with a cash account, shares are not lent. But they may want to confirm. If shares are purchased from a margin account, they were likely lent. Changing to a cash account, or having a broker recall the shares to protect the voting rights works.

This article reports that  the ""**informational sophistication of lenders is the primary driver of informative stock recalls**, which cause significant damage to profitable short positions. "" Paraphrasing...whether or not retail buyers are **dumb money**.

# Voting

Shareholders  are entitled to vote by proxy on the big issues that impact a company's financials even if they can't attend the meeting in person. In advance of the annual general meeting of a company, shareholders will receive a package in the mail containing financial data, operations results and announce important issues ‚Äì such as proposals for changes to the company's share structure or mergers and acquisitions. If, however, shareholders are not able to attend an annual (or special) meeting, they can vote on proposals by means of a proxy, one of the documents that is included in the pre-meeting mailing package.

At that time this was the price that Citron told people GME will go back to soon. It tipped me off there like this is tipping me off right now.

Because right now on eToro you can just do one thing. You can use the ""offline"" tool to sell your shares. What if paperhands on eToro are selling right now through the offline tool to make to market stay low. What if this is actually intentional? eToro also stopped trading like RobinHood and all our breakers were going on longer than on the actual market. This all seems very fishy to me.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!

I AM JUST A SMOOTH BRAINED CRAYON ESTING IDIOT WHO LIKES THE STOCK. 

While we are still likely a bit away until the squeeze is Squozed, I just wanted to take a moment to point out the massive buying opportunity this is going to create once the dust settles. I also would like to talk about GMEs potential and just how high the ceiling may go. We can do this by looking at past short squeezes to help us estimate. I also am going to talk about how to best manage any potential GME earnings for long term financial success.

There are been some notable shorts that have hit stupid prices such as HCMC back in 2013. Max share price in that was north of 60 mill. That being said the HCMC short was mostly a war between 2 hedge funds so it was easier to drive the price up that high after the short started. Since only one party had the majority of the shares and could essentially pick whatever as their selling price. 

GME has a has more shares shorted then HCMC did and less float % so the potential is there for gme to hit an unbelievably high ceiling. This mostly depends on when people are willing to sell and that‚Äôs difficult to predict with gme considering the large amount of retail owners. But if enough people hold gme could possibly hit 1mill + a share. I personally think 1mill is a bit of a stretch but it‚Äôs possible. Considering how shorted gme is and how little float is available I expect it to hit at-least 50k probably much higher. So people will potentialy be able to retire because of their GME earnings.  Assuming they have enough shares and sell at a high enough price.

First of all, use your gains to payoff any outstanding debit and put away money for future payments. I am sure many of you like myself have a large amount of debit weather it be from university like myself, a car, house, or even credit card debit. So for high interest debit pay that shit off, it will only hurt you in the long run. I.E credit cards and any short term loans higher then 10% and possibly any above 5%. 

As for long term loans such as your house or college that‚Äôs mostly going to depend on your finical health. If you make millions off of gme and have a solid credit score it might be worth paying off all your debits. I personably I think it would be better to put the money to pay for these debits in a CD and continue paying your monthly payments to maintain your credit score. That being said look into refinancing your loans as you should be able to get a lower interest rate. 

Second let‚Äôs talk taxes, I know taxes aren‚Äôt any fun but they are a large part of keeping our nations functioning and we have a fuck ton of Covid Vaccines to pay for. So taxes are important no one likes them but they are one of the necessary evils of society. So assuming you recently bought your shares of GME and the squeeze happens within the next 11 months likely much sooner anything you make from gme will be considered short term gains. If you are an American like myself that means it is taxed as regular income meaning the tax brackets that no one seems to understand apply. 

So lets say you make 1mill off of GME, you bough 10 shares on a whim and sold at 100k a share making a tidy profit. So that‚Äôs 1mill taxed basically as regular income. In the United States we have a marginal tax system so the more money you make the higher % of that income will be taxed, sorta.  So in the US we have 7 tax brackets as of 2021. 

10% $0 to $9,875

12% $9,876 to $40,125

22% $40,126 to $85,525

24% 85,226 to 163,300

32% $163,301 to $207,350

35% $207,351 to $518,400

37% all income above $518,401 

So you may think well shit our hypothetical 1 mill is in the highest bracket meaning I am going to pay 370k in federal taxes alone, but that‚Äôs not the case. So in the US every one starts paying at the lowest tax bracket and it goes up from their so our 1 mill would be taxed as such 

$9,875 at 10%

$30,250 at 12%

$45,400 at 22%

$77,775 at 24%

$44,050 at 32%

$311,050 at 35% 

and $481,600 at 37% 

Leaving you with a federal tax bill of $334,427

You may also be taxed by your state government depending on where you live. If like myself you live in the state of Virginia your income would be taxed by the state at a rate of 

2% $0-$3000

$60 + 3% $3001-$5000

$120 + 5% $5001-$17000

$720 + 5.75% all income above $17001

Leaving us with a state tax bill of $57,242.50 with a grand total of $391,669.5 in taxes. Ouch 

Oh well 600k plus is still a lot of money and you could use that to move to a state like Texas that dose not tax your income. That means any future short term gains you earn will only be taxed by the federal government. 

Now let‚Äôs say you have held your GME shares for a year or longer. You lucky dog, that is considered a long term capital gain and is taxed at a flat rate of 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your income 

0% $0-$40,000

15% $40,001-$441,450

20% all income above $441,451 

Meaning you would pay $179,921.75 in taxes leaving you with a hearty $820,078.25 

So make sure you guys do the math and put away as much money as you need to for taxes next year. I am personally going to put my tax money into a short term CD so it‚Äôs still making some money while I am waiting to file. But you may also keep it in a high interest saving account. 

Okay now for the exciting part the potential stock market crash brought on by GME. 

I know that the hype around GME has gotten a lot of people investing for the first time in there lives and I think that is a great thing. Though I am worried these people will become one time investors and will liquidate their accounts once this is over. If this goes how I expect it to the Squeeze will have a ripple effect on the market. The hedge funds  who bet against GME will need to Liquidate their accounts to cover the shorts. Remember these hedge funds have an insane amount of capital and will by law be required to cover ever share they went short on. That means billions of dollars worth of selloffs, that will in turn scare other investors who will then proceed to Liquidate their shares, resulting in a huge market crash. 

I personally think this crash will result in a 40-50% drop in the markets value and will represent a great time to get in on high value stocks at a discounted rate. 
In short even if you only make 100k off of 
GME the following crash could still make you a millionaire if you reinvest in the right stocks after the dip. Heck even if you do not own any Gme shares this will be a great time for you to start investing. 

This is going to be a time to conserve your capital and set up the potential for long term gains. That means companies and ETFs with a solid track record that can Weather the storm. Don‚Äôt worry their will still be plenty of dosh for you to be bullish with, but at the end of the day we don‚Äôt want to be like lottery winners and blow all of our money in 5 years time. We want to make this money last and consistently grow. To help give you guys a general idea I am going to make a list of Low, Medium and High Risk stocks I plan on buying or increasing my position on after the crash. 


Low Risk: Any major ETF, index funds are your friend.  ETFs generally speaking are relatively stable and will have steady returns baring any major finical event. There is still some risk involved but index funds are generally much safer then any individual company because they come with Diversity built into them. For example the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF ticker: VOO. This is a portfolio made up of the 500 largest Companies in the United States with large holdings in Apple, Amazon, Facebook etc. meaning it‚Äôs a great way to invest in these large Companies while mitigating risk because let‚Äôs say facebooks performs poorly or even goes bankrupt (I wish) You still have all the gain from Apple and Amazon who presumably performed well.

 That being said not all ETFs are created equal and will have higher risk such as ETFs that focus on emerging markets let‚Äôs use AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF as an example Ticker:YOLO. So this is a Weed ETF and focused on the cannabis industry. Legitimate weed businesses are still relatively young and in a gray legal area in some countries (The United States) and outright Illegal in others. That means there is an inherent risk investing in cannabis. Personally I think cannabis legalization is only a matter of time in the United States but we still don‚Äôt know which companies will sink or swim meaning there is higher risk then an ETF in a more established industry, but it is still lower risk then buying individual week stocks.

ETFs I plan on buying after the crash.

Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (ticker: VOO)

Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)

Fidelity Quality Factor ETF (FQAL) 

Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ)

Higher Risk ETFs

AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF (YOLO)

Cannabis ETF (THCX)

These last 2 ETFs as stated above are a higher risk investment especially considering their recent volatility. I personally believe the weed industry has a lot of room to grow and these ETFs should see decent returns. That being said these may not be the best for long term growth and not good for every investor. 

Medium Risk: My Medium Risk picks are of Companies with solid track records that I believe will continue to have consistent growth. They are a higher risk then an ETF because your putting more eggs in one basket, but there is also higher potential for growth. All of these companies have a proven track record, have weathered market crashes in the past and have potential for growth beyond there current share value. 

Amazon (AMZN) 

Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson (JNJ)

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)

Sony Corp (SNE)

Google (GOOGL)


High Risk: these are stocks with a higher risks then the above shares but I believe have the potential to offer massive returns. Investments into these stocks may not be for everyone and you should conduct your own research before buying in. I will also share my thoughts on these stocks and there potential growth. 

GameStop (GME) 

While we are all on the gme train for the big short I think the company also has great potential to reinvent itself in the next several years. This is mostly due to Ryan Cohen the former Chewy CEO who offered up a plan on how gme can reinvent itself in an open letter he released back in November. In short Cohen plans on turning the brick and mortar retail business into an e commerce game supplier with an emphasis on high end PCs and components. I think that this new business strategy has real potential especially with all the publicity game stop has generated leading up to the short. I believe it‚Äôs very possible for the shares to reach the January 28th prices in several years after the short and would be a great way to both support the company that helped make us rich and increase our capital. 

BlackBerry (BB) 

yes another meme stock BlackBerry had its own price spike back in January briefly hitting $25 a share. Now BB was once know for its high end Mobile devices before being supplanted by Apple and Android. In the years since then they have been focusing on software Encryption and have emerged as a leader In cyber security. This will be a very important Industry in the coming years as self driving vehicles and other autonomous forms of transportation become widespread. They could very well become the gold standard of cyber security and protecting self driving cars. They recently signed an agreement with Amazon and have a lot of potential for growth over the next decade. 

Last but not least Tesla (TSlA) 

Tesla has had an interesting past few years becoming the worlds most valuable automotive brand while not selling all that many cars. I would argue this is because of Tesla‚Äôs business model of Horizontal integration. They are making everything they need for the production of their vehicles and also branching out into solar Tec. That being said most of Tesla‚Äôs value is speculating how big the company will get and it still has a lot of challenges to overcome such as reducing the cost of its battery‚Äôs. That being said I think it still has a ton of potential for growth especially after a market crash. I am putting it in the high risk Category simply because it‚Äôs value is mostly based on speculation. 


Anyway that is my current thought on how the market will preform after the gme short and my buying plans after the crash. 

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

This is my own speculations about how the market will perform assuming there is a crash after the  GameStop short.  While I have been investing for years I am still a crayon eating, smooth brained idiot Furry. Who is probably just going to spend his earnings on dumb shit like another 3k carpet suit. In short I am just a dumb diamond handed ape who pretends to be a fox on the internet, and also likes the stock and all the other ones I have mentioned above.


EDIT: 

Wow this really blew up. I just wanted to say, I appreciate all the positivity and great questions. I plan on going through all the comments and answering as many questions as I can when I get off work. I don‚Äôt think I will manage to get to all of them, but I will try my best. 

That being said I have noticed a lot of questions about the HCMC Short and taxes so I will go ahead an address those here. 

As for HCMC I have gotten a few questions regarding why I included information on it and if I could provide an additional information simply because it is almost  none existent on the google. But basically two hedge funds had a small war with each other and it resulted in a short squeeze. This squeeze was started by a revise stock split, basically shares of HCMC were consolidated increasing the value of each individual share and it set off a chain reaction sending the price soaring from 2mill ish to above 60 million.  

HCMC was a special event and dose not reflect how a gme short would start. I included it to highlight the type of % increases a short can cause. 

Taxes, I included my tax break down as an example and simplified it. As was pointed out to me in one post I did not reduce the initial investment from the selling point when calculating taxes. This was intentional and I am sorry if I confused anyone. 

If you guys need help filing your taxes after this I highly recommend finding an accounting service to help make sure your taking all the deductions you can and properly filing. That being said if you make a massive about of money off of this find a tax lawyer who has experience dealing with ultra wealthy clients as they will be able to help you navigate the confusing tax system and minimize your expenses. 


Finally, I have noticed several comments regarding broker services like robin hood possibility restricting trading again on the verge of starting the squeeze. While it is possible trading may be halted again by brokers who may or may not have conflicting interests, halting trading again would only kick the can down the road again. 

The last trading halt infuriated so many investors that for many of us this is no longer about the money, it‚Äôs about sending a message. It is also likely that short positions were increased after the trading halt in January as a means of recouping losses. The hedge funds expected retail investors like myself to sell off in droves but everyone held. Now we‚Äôre are back to where we started only now the hedge funds stand to lose even more money when the shorts are called in. I believe it is simply a matter time until this all comes crashing down on top of the hedge funds. 

That being said I am not clairvoyant, and this is just my speculation. We have no idea what will happen in the next few weeks, but I am confident. I think the numbers are on our side and we are going to bring about a financial revolution. But only time will tell, regardless of what happens it has been an honor holding with you üíéüôå.

Melvin Capital &amp; The Final Boss of Gamestop,"***‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù***

‚Äï **Sun Tzu,** [**The Art of War**]

While reading all of the great (and even subpar) DD (data driven, game theory postulations, etc.) while diamond-handing GME, I've been wondering to myself this question -

#**EXACTLY WHO IS THE SHORT SELLER(S) THAT GAMESTONK IS DEALING WITH?**

This question is vitally important because hypothetical $GME shareholders needs to know exactly who his/her ""enemy"" is.

I've come to the following conclusions: (ALSO, THE TL;DR IS CONTAINED IN THESE FOUR POINTS)

1. **Melvin Capital is completely out of the picture, and very possibly facing fund liquidation in the near-future. \[Melvin started 2021 with 12.5 billion in assets under management ""AUM""\]**
2. **Citadel &amp; Point72 are the ""final bosses"" who have taken up Melvin Capital's position. \[Citadel has AUM as of October 2020 of 35 billion; P72 AUM as of July 2020 of 17.2 billion\]**
3. **Both Hedge Funds have doubled down in their positions, after having bought-out Melvin's short position (at $2 billion from Citadel, and $750 million from P72).**
4. **The short squeeze has definitely NOT happened, and the can has been kicked down the road.**

##**1 Melvin Capital is completely out of the picture, and very possibly facing fund liquidation in the near-future.**

In watching Gabe Plotkin's testimony, I was wondering why he looked like a literal cuck (not just a figurative one). He looked like someone *literally* shot his wife, and raped his dog.

For the last two weeks, I assumed the major ""enemy"" was Melvin Capital, still. And that they had just rolled their shorts, manipulated the market to reduce their exposure, and holding on for dear life hoping they can drive Gamestop into the ground through their various manipulative tactics.

However, as it pertains to Melvin Capital specifically - this thesis doesn't address the following inconsistences;

&gt;Melvin has stated they closed out their Gamestop short position(s).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin's wife is purportedly filing for divorce (citing irreconcilable differences).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin looks like a literal cuck now. 

&gt;Melvin Capital REALIZED actual losses (ie., were forced to cover some shares) at some point, to the tune of losing 30-50% of the AUM value (up to 6 billion in investors money) - evidenced by the stock price dips of various long positions owned by Melvin Capital during late January (Notice how their biggest holdings - FISV, FB, EXPE all dip dramatically around January 28th. This is when Melvin had to start liquidating).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin mentions his investors multiple times in his written testimony for the Congressional Hearing. He states that investors in Melvin suffered significant losses. That it is now Melvin's job to earn it back.

Now, imagine you're a millionaire or billionaire passive investor in Melvin Capital. A limited partner that placed money in an aggressive securities trading hedge fund. They have great returns, you're happy, they're happy.

Now imagine one day you wake up and you see Gamestop ad-nauseum **LITERALLY EVERYWHERE** on every media available, and then you see MELVIN Capital, those slick-haired fucks that you invested some millions (or billions), and the headline reads ""MELVIN CAPITAL LOSES 50% OF AUM IN A MONTH DUE TO GAMESTONK"".

First fucking phone call you make is to the hedge fund, demanding redemption of your money (you are withdrawing your capital from the fund). Now, assuming a majority of LPs of Melvin do the same (which is completely realistic), your fund now has to lock-down the outflow, has to sell off all of their positions, buy-back all shorts, and essentially liquidate the assets and return it to the investors. You're essentially going out of business (but not bankrupt).

This is an inevitability. I don't see how any investor in Melvin sees that they lost 30-50% of the value in one month, due to widely reported greed and irresponsible shorting, and think ""okay, this is copasetic, I fucks with that.""

No way. Melvin is facing liquidation.

However, if the cost to close out all the Gamestop short positions, all at once, will create a massive short squeeze that will literally bankrupt the fund - what do you do? What if you've recklessly overshorted a low-liquidity stock to the extent that closing your short position would mean literally selling off every last long position, losing ALL investor contributions, what do you do?

If I were Gabe Plotkin, I would call my wife, tell her to divorce me immediately. I may be personally liable for the financial losses sustained by my greed. I need to make sure we protect 50% of our assets and make those ""untouchable"" in lawsuits, bankruptcy, etc.

The next thing I would do is to phone my old bosses (and partners in crime) and tell them that now, because of this short position, I have a liquidity problem if I have to buy the $GME shares at escalating market prices, and Melvin will lose all of it's value (Which, of course, means that Citadel, Point72, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin will loses the billions they've invested in Melvin). Furthermore, if I, Gabe Plotkin, have to cover these Gamestop shorts - than any other hedge funds whose hands are in the cookie jar will be forced to cover their shorts AS WELL. Because the escalating share price will start to pop the margins of even bigger funds. Then THOSE funds (Citadel, Point72) are at risk of complete insolvency as well.

Therefore;

##**2 Citadel &amp; Point72 are the ""final bosses"" who have taken up Melvin Capital's position.**

If I'm Steve Cohen, and I've invested money in my former employee - that snot-faced Gabe Plotkin... Why would I hitch my trailer onto his losing play? The truth of the matter is, I wouldn't, unless I had a significant exposure risk as well.

Which leads me to my next point;

&gt;I believe the 2.75 Billion dollar bailout was effectively structured behind closed doors as as buy-out of Melvin's short position - to prevent insolvency.

Effectively, I think that Citadel and Point72 could not afford to let Melvin cover their Gamestop shorts. If they covered, it's game over for all the capital invested in Melvin, and would trigger the dominoes that could very realistically lead to the insolvency of Citadel and Point72 (with escalating buy prices of Gamestop, and the real threat of getting short called and having to sell off assets to then cover).

Therefore, they structured this ""bailout"" by arranging a darkpool sale of Gamestop stock (which are shorted) ""Okay, we'll take over your 100 million shares short position, which **costs** us 2.75 billion on paper value"" The 100 million share position is just a fictional number, but you get the gist. They're buying out 100% of Melvin's shorts. They borrow the stock from various stock-brokers, (unbeknownst to the owners of the stock) and then give them to Melvin so Melvin can close out their short positions without liquidating their full portfolio or having to buy the stocks at the market price at that time. This buy-out factually verifies Gabe's statement that Melvin's short position in Gamestop has been closed... by Melvin. But opened by the bigger fish.

Because Citadel and P72 are bigger firms, and likely had less exposure, they can weather the storm of a short call much better than Melvin. Therefore, they postpone a short squeeze, which protects their very existence. Remember, short squeeze = all 3 funds will either become insolvent or lose a VAST majority of their value - potentially $50 billion+ in losses.

##**3 Both Hedge Funds have doubled down in their positions, after having bought-out Melvin's short position**

Now the remarkable thing about Citadel thereby opening a short position, is that they have access to even more tools than Melvin did in order to manipulate the stock. If you've opened up a massive short position in Gamestop, what do you want? You need the stock to go down, or now your ass is on the line if the squeeze happens.

Citadel, through conduits, are essentially part owners of the DTCC. The DTCC raised margin requirements on brokers, and Robinhood got the short end of the stick. To be clear, however, the order came from the top (the DTCC). That's why various OTHER brokers had to restrict trading GME and other high volatility stocks as well. Any/all stocks with short exposure from Melvin's shorting, which now became Citadel's short position, got restricted.

Citadel also suspiciously was reported to have opened a shit ton of bearish positions (puts and/or shorts) on Gamestop right before the controversial (and likely, illegal) stock restrictions on January 28th. Now why would they do that, in the face of exponential almost 10,000% growth of Gamestop stock, on that exact day - unless... of course... they triggered the sell-off and benefited hugely from it.

Further, it also allowed them to make a fuck-ton of money when they bought-out Melvin's position. They probably paid $50-75/share\~, the price of Gamestop stock on January 25th, and now have made a profit from that.

They massively profited from their bearish position at the stock's ATH on January 28th, and have even profited (if/when they actually cover the borrowed shares) on paper from the short-position buyout.

The thing is... they can't ever close this short position and ""realize"" this gain because doing so would trigger that short squeeze, on low volume, with high volatility. They NEED paper hands to sell en masse so they can reduce their short exposure.

##**4 The short squeeze has definitely NOT happened, and the can has been kicked down the road.**

And that is why so much capital, and effort, and carefully crafted testimony during the Congressional hearing, and the changes in policy to under-report short positions in major financial publications, and on and on and on have been going on. They **need** FUD to spread. They need retail to relinquish their shares. Because they're not getting the shares they require from institutions. They need the apes to sell. That way they can finally cover their position at a low price, without triggering a short squeeze. That's why the short position has, on paper, been shifted to $GME holding ETFs like XRT. To scare retail into thinking that the short squeeze is DONE or NOT HAPPENING.

They're trying to tap-dance over a million laser beams.

But shareholders should recognize this, and not let them off the hook.

By myriad of potential catalysts (stock split, shareholder recall, massive upward buying pressure through a press releaser that shifts public sentiment on the fundamental forward-facing value of the stock, EVEN a black-swan event that reduces the value of the HF's holdings), the price WILL spike up, especially on low volume. The shorts WILL face a liquidity crisis, because they HAVE NOT exited their positions. They're praying that paper hands all sell the stock down, while they continually flood the market will shorted stocks (hence the up to 400% short percentage of the float).

Because, again, they have a time crunch. They have to avoid dozens of potential catalysts.

Shareholders just need to hold.

I think what they‚Äôre trying to do is to give normies hope that Monday will be the start of the squeeze (hence the sway of the overall sentiment and positive news for GME), and attempt to tank the stock price one last time as their last resort to scare away as many retail investors as possible.

If you haven‚Äôt noticed already, there have been suddenly a change of narrative from the news after the hearing. This is comical because of how harsh they‚Äôve been towards GME.

DD on IOTA: will it gain x7 over the next 5 weeks??,"Firstly lets observe the chart below, a x7 gain from here will represent much less than half its previous ATH retracement, yet IOTA is in a much stronger position now than it has ever been in given its overhauled technology and corporate partnerships, realistically it should be trading x2 its ATH but it is sitting at a fraction of that value because of massive dumping due to a hack on its old software that has been completely resolved, it now stands as one of the most secure networks out there operating stronghold functionality resistant against all known current forms of attack.

2021 is set to be the year IOTA lives up to its 2017 hype, and it is very likely to emerge as the biggest unexpected breakout success amongst the top 25 coins. Key players in the corporate IOT space are now taking IOTA deadly seriously and IOTA recently announced a partnership with DELL and INTEL, two of the biggest global names in IOT. Sources:

in fact IOTA is somewhat of a sleeping giant that has been developing monster partnerships under the radar over 2020 that have been not well publicized (source: [https://usethebitcoin.com/list-guide-iota-partnerships/](https://usethebitcoin.com/list-guide-iota-partnerships/)) - IOTA actually works very well now and industry knows it, it has an easy $3 - $4 potential by the end of February and $8-$9 price target by end of March.

**Development Research:**

Pretty much every single design issue of the past such as ternary, PoW for IoT, a custom hash function, the algorithms, the data structures, the transaction layout, reusable address, light wallet , low TPS , list goes on ... have been completely reworked and solved, moreover, they were agreed that they had to be resolved by Iota Foundation (IF) developers themselves **openly** on discord as well as twitter.

After departure of CFB from IF , they changed everything with the Chrysalis release.

Chrysalis 1.5 already implemented: Result was iota transaction time reduced from hours to 10 seconds you can check it yourself by downloading trinity wallet also tested at 1000tps.

Chrysalis 2.0 is implemented on test net after successful security audits of the firefly wallet. Chrysalis 2.0 will be implemented on mainnet by Q1 March 2021 that will make IOTA production ready. Hence, $8.5 price target by March. Expect a string of partnership announcements leading to $4.5 price target by end of February.

Coordinator will be successfully removed by Q4 2021, research has already proved it and moved to Sharding, only implementation is balance, Pollen is already running successfully on the test net.

Once Coordicide is successfully implemented, **IOTA will solve the blockchain trilemma and will be one of best dlt available for adoption. End of year price target is $20+ and IOTA to be a top 5 coin.** It is also to be noted that data value transactions are completely decentralized , even without coordicide the tangle can be used by big techs , IOTA alongwith Dell and Intel will present demonstration of project Alvarium on 24th Feb.

Lastly, the future smart city NEOM ([https://www.neom.com/](https://www.neom.com/)) is rumoured to be working with IOTA and an influx of Saudi interest and investment is due to be announced this year ($5bn). This could push IOTA to reach $30 price target if it comes to fruition.

IOTA is also exploring a partnership with Cardano: [https://heraldsheets.com/iota-co-founder-dominik-considers-partnership-to-bridge-cardano-ada/](https://heraldsheets.com/iota-co-founder-dominik-considers-partnership-to-bridge-cardano-ada/)

Melvin Capital &amp; Gamestop's Final Boss,"*‚ÄúIf you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.‚Äù*
‚Äï Sun Tzu, The Art of War

While reading all of the great DD while diamond-handing GME, I've been wondering to myself this question -

#**EXACTLY WHO IS THE SHORT SELLER(S) THAT GAMESTONK IS DEALING WITH?**

This question is vitally important because $GME shareholders needs to know exactly who their ""enemy"" is.

I've come to the following conclusions: (ALSO, THE TL;DR IS CONTAINED IN THESE FOUR POINTS)

**1.	Melvin Capital is completely out of the picture, and very possibly facing fund liquidation in the near-future. [Melvin started 2021 with 12.5 billion in assets under management ""AUM""]**

**2.	Citadel &amp; Point72 are the ""final bosses"" who have taken up Melvin Capital's position. [Citadel has AUM as of October 2020 of 35 billion; P72 AUM as of July 2020 of 17.2 billion]**
**3.	Both Hedge Funds have doubled down in their positions, after having bought-out Melvin's short position (at $2 billion from Citadel, and $750 million from P72).**

**4.	The short squeeze has definitely NOT happened, and the can has been kicked down the road.**

##**1 Melvin Capital is completely out of the picture, and very possibly facing fund liquidation in the near-future.**

In watching Gabe Plotkin's testimony, I was wondering why he looked like a literal cuck (not just a figurative one). He looked like someone literally shot his wife, and raped his dog.

For the last two weeks, I assumed the major ""enemy"" was Melvin Capital, still. And that they had just rolled their shorts, manipulated the market to reduce their exposure, and holding on for dear life hoping they can drive Gamestop into the ground through their various manipulative tactics.

However, as it pertains to Melvin Capital specifically - this thesis doesn't address the following inconsistences;

&gt;Melvin has stated they closed out their Gamestop short position(s).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin's wife is purportedly filing for divorce (citing irreconcilable differences).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin looks like a literal cuck now.

&gt;Melvin Capital REALIZED actual losses (ie., were forced to cover some shares) at some point, to the tune of losing 30-50% of the AUM value (up to 6 billion in investors money) - evidenced by the stock price dips of various long positions owned by Melvin Capital during late January (Notice how their biggest holdings - FISV, FB, EXPE all dip dramatically around January 28th. This is when Melvin had to start liquidating).

&gt;Gabe Plotkin mentions his investors multiple times in his written testimony for the Congressional Hearing. He states that investors in Melvin suffered significant losses. That it is now Melvin's job to earn it back.

Now, imagine you're a millionaire or billionaire passive investor in Melvin Capital. A limited partner that placed money in an aggressive securities trading hedge fund. They have great returns, you're happy, they're happy.

Now imagine one day you wake up and you see Gamestop ad-nauseum LITERALLY EVERYWHERE on every media available, and then you see MELVIN Capital, those slick-haired fucks that you invested some millions (or billions), and the headline reads ""MELVIN CAPITAL LOSES 50% OF AUM IN A MONTH DUE TO GAMESTONK"".

First fucking phone call you make is to the hedge fund, demanding redemption of your money (you are withdrawing your capital from the fund). Now, assuming a majority of LPs of Melvin do the same (which is completely realistic), your fund now has to lock-down the outflow, has to sell off all of their positions, buy-back all shorts, and essentially liquidate the assets and return it to the investors. You're essentially going out of business (but not bankrupt).

This is an inevitability. I don't see how any investor in Melvin sees that they lost 30-50% of the value in one month, due to widely reported greed and irresponsible shorting, and think ""okay, this is copasetic, I fucks with that.""

No way. Melvin is facing liquidation.

However, if the cost to close out all the Gamestop short positions, all at once, will create a massive short squeeze that will literally bankrupt the fund - what do you do? What if you've recklessly overshorted a low-liquidity stock to the extent that closing your short position would mean literally selling off every last long position, losing ALL investor contributions, what do you do?

If I were Gabe Plotkin, I would call my wife, tell her to divorce me immediately. I may be personally liable for the financial losses sustained by my greed. I need to make sure we protect 50% of our assets and make those ""untouchable"" in lawsuits, bankruptcy, etc.

The next thing I would do is to phone my old bosses (and partners in crime) and tell them that now, because of this short position, I have a liquidity problem if I have to buy the $GME shares at escalating market prices, and Melvin will lose all of it's value (Which, of course, means that Citadel, Point72, Steven Cohen, Kenneth Griffin will loses the billions they've invested in Melvin).

Because the escalating share price will start to pop the margins of even bigger funds. Then THOSE funds (Citadel, Point72) are at risk of complete insolvency as well.

Are ya‚Äôll doing ACAT (lol) transfers out of RH or planning on waiting for after the squeeze?,"Okay so one thing that stood out to me in the hearing was the citing of a law that if RH was unable to meet their on hand cash requirements or clearinghouse requirements or whatever that they‚Äôd be forced to liquidate all customers stock.  

Obviously that‚Äôs hella sus after the shit they pulled January 27th, we‚Äôd be able to likely fight that, but I don‚Äôt really feel like dealing with it.  I want my tendies now!

It feels like the HF‚Äôs on the other side of this would be super incentivized to do coerce RH into doing this this to involuntarily force people to give up their shares.  Im so torn about whether to transfer to fidelity and possibly miss a squeeze or to just let them sit in RH and possibly be liquidated.

By initiating an ACAT I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade, but neither would RH.  My tendies would be protected!  It would be really great though to have way more money sooner to catch the squeeze than later.  But also this could turn into a long and strong slow squeeze that could last many months.

I have no cash in my account (also I am on the downgraded cash account), and got notified I had an account deficit because RH gold charged me $5 and I wouldn‚Äôt be permitted to sell or trade in general I think until I‚Äôd initiated a transfer.  Transferring $5 in now, but upon going through Fidelity‚Äôs ACAT transfer flow I got a warning that there would likely be delays with transferring out of RH if I‚Äôd recently initiated a transfer.  But I‚Äôm wondering if this only applies if you‚Äôre using instant deposit or margin?

Anyone else have thoughts on this?  Most of my GME shares are in RH, but I also have about 20% of my shares in fidelity, E*TRADE, and Charles Schwab in descending order.  Thinking that I could be happy knowing I could sell that and just keep the rest for the long term gains.

I first got in over thanksgiving at $13 and have been steadily upping my position in the dips.  I haven‚Äôt even thought about selling.  And doing this will contribute to a longer squeeze and ensure the safe return of our apes and apettes at 500.

I remember a lot of discussion about whether or not to do this at the end of January but I decided not to so as not because I didn‚Äôt want to tie up my shares during a squeeze.  I also didn‚Äôt have anything in other brokerages yet.  So many people are pissed off with RH I‚Äôm seeing a lot of other financial subreddits with highly upvoted posts talking about transferring out.  If lots of us were to do this and boycotting were to trend, we would likely make the squeeze last a long time just on our own.  I think we own more than officially exists in the float, plus since we literally can‚Äôt sell we further improve our position by turning our bodies into diamonds and restricting tradeable float.


Anyways not sure what I‚Äôm asking really!  This is not financial advice.  Also please let me know if any of this isn‚Äôt correct and I‚Äôll edit.

I will not take financial advice without doing my own due diligence.

Was trying to get my fix of confirmation bias of GME for the weekend, and this is what I found. The highlighted % of portfolio on -02/16/2021 seemed to be doubled from prior Dec 12 2020. What does this mean in terms of the actual shares that they currently has in position?

Theoretical question on collective lending account rather than sell off panic,"I was wondering, given that likely large chunks of the economy are on the hook.

Could we not keep the stock forever, reclaim our time ehhh stock, i.e. make sure no one can ever borrow it without going through us.

Then, set the interest to e.g. 10%, collect it in a collective account. Then each GME shareholder gets one of these money guns and once a week we stuff them with the money from the collective account.

I could do this for the rest of my life basically.

Like why would I ‚Äúever‚Äù sell the stock, if I know no one else ever sold the stock?! Why take a quick profit it I could get paid interest forever?

Regret versus Fear: Relevant scenarios for APES who got robbed and potential for new GME buyers,"# THE FOLLOWING IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR NOR ADVOCATING ANYONE TO BUY THE STOCK I AM MERELY OPENING UP DISCUSSION OF THE POSSIBLE EMOTIONS WE MAY HAVE BASED ON SCENARIOS THAT CAN HAPPEN

***TLDR****: If it were me I would hold at least 1 GME in the case that GME becomes the MOASS and crashes the rest of the market so I don't regret it for the rest of my life*

**Relevant scenarios that I can think of for APES who got robbed by Melvin and co. and have been living in fear ever since:**

1. You kept up at 80% losses and finally sell it all off and GME goes bankrupt

&gt;**Outcome:** You get 20% of your money back

2. You do not sell and GME goes bankrupt

&gt;**Outcome:** You lose 100% of your money

3. You do not sell and GME does not squeeze nor go bankrupt

&gt;**Outcome:** You do not lose any money and can continue to cost average down until you are not in the red anymore

4. The squeeze happens again and you paper hands at a price that is ***significantly*** lower than [what it can be](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lmou8l/gme_dd_price_target_my_personal_price_target_from/) (theoretically infinite) and the price exceeds what you sold it at due to everyone else holding

&gt;**Outcome:** You get gains or maybe go neutral but have to live everyday of the squeeze while thinking ""I should have held"". You might start posting negative sentiment and getting others to sell because you regret your decision of selling out of fear. Depending on the final outcome of the price you may regret this decision for the rest of your life.

5. You kept up at 80% losses and finally sell it all off and GME squeezes into the **tens of thousands** ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lmou8l/gme_dd_price_target_my_personal_price_target_from/))

&gt;**Outcome:** You have to cope with the fact that you sold out of the fear of losing the remaining 20% of your investment when this situation could have been the best bet you made in your life with a multiplier on said bet being in the hundreds. Regardless of if you were a betting APE to begin with, you no longer find gambling or casinos enjoyable. You regret your decision to relieve your fear of losing the rest of your investment at the time for the remainder of your life.

6. You hold GME past the peak squeeze due to greed

&gt;**Note:** Many shills will have you think you are currently in this situation but the numbers are not on their side, do your own DD  
&gt;  
&gt;**Outcome:** Regardless of whether or not you got some gains on the way down, are currently in the red, or GME goes bankrupt you question why you were so greedy and feel bad because of this. You may try to convince yourself there is another squeeze but the numbers won't be on your side now because the squeeze actually squoze. 

7. You hold GME forever

&gt;*""Heroes hold but Legends never sell""*   
&gt;  
&gt;**Outcome:** You are a LEGEND and whatever happens to GME does not affect you in the slightest

Now ask yourself if you think fear is worse than regret. I, personally, am not scared even if scenario 2 happens because I went in this well aware that I could lose it all. But for me, regret is worse than fear. If I was scared I'd only have to live with it until I lost all of my money. I'd have no more money and thus I cannot be scared of losing it anymore. There is no time limit for regret. If scenario 4, 6, and especially 5 happen, then I'd be living with regret for the rest of my life. I may get help, seek therapy, temporarily come to peace with it but there is ALWAYS the potential for the regret to come back. I could never get away from it.

    

**Relevant scenarios that I can think of for people who are not currently in or have little GME**

1.  You believe that GME has already squoze and GME goes bankrupt:

&gt;**Outcome:** You wonder what all the craze was about and justify that whatever was going on was nonsense. The little guys already won at 500 and everyone who kept their GME just could not see this fact. You are glad you did not fall for the GME craze.

2. You believe in the DD but that the little guys never win and thus do not buy GME. GME does not squeeze.

&gt;**Outcome:** You continue to believe the little guys can never win and have an attitude of ""I told you so"" to the APES who ""got tried by fire"".

3. You believe in the DD but that the little guys never win and thus do not buy GME. GME does squeeze into the **tens of thousands** ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lmou8l/gme_dd_price_target_my_personal_price_target_from/))

&gt;**Outcome:** You wonder why you were not bold enough to put your money where your mouth is. You could have been set for life! You experience self-doubt and wonder why you didn't do it. 

4. You believe in the DD and buy GME with money you can afford to AND willing to lose. GME does not squeeze 

&gt;**Outcome:** You lost some money but you can say that you were apart of history. 

5. You believe in the DD and buy GME with money you can afford to lose AND willing to lose. GME does squeeze into the **tens of thousands** ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/),[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lmou8l/gme_dd_price_target_my_personal_price_target_from/))

&gt;**Outcome:** Buying GME was one of the best decisions of your life and can brag about it to all of your friends who doubted you. You are proud of yourself for and GME share holders around the world for holding

6. You YOLO money that you need because of hype

&gt;**Outcome:** You become the fearful APE in the first set of scenarios and open yourself to hedgefund price manipuation 

7. You do not buy GME and the [market crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) due to the GME squeeze

&gt;**Outcome:** Most likely you would collectively lose money on all of your investments (if you had any). You regret not buying GME

7. You buy GME and the [market crashes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnvvu3/why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a_collapse_of_the/) due to the GME squeeze

&gt;**Outcome:** GME hedges you against market crash and you are glad that you bought it

    

**Relevant for both scenarios:**

1. The squeeze happens again and is prevented again.

&gt;**Outcome:** People leave the American market like how people [left Robinhood](https://fortune.com/2021/02/19/robinhood-brand-damage-gamestop-hedge-funds-wallstreetbets-reddit-stocks-gme-amc/) because they are now disillusioned from the American Dream.

For Those Who Bought High and Held Long - Hang In There (Part 1),"*This is not financial advice, nor should it constitute or be construed as instruction for any individual reader, or group of readers, to act or make a decision in any financial market or field without any grasp of the personal situation, risk tolerance, or desired goals inherent in such an environment. Seeking independent, professional advice from a qualified and licensed expert is always the optimum avenue for navigating any type of existing or future involvement in the world of finance, securities and asset management.

This series of posts are a social commentary of recent events involving distinct parties and their interactions across various social platforms, an understanding of the conduct of the various agents connected, and an observation of the marketing strategies designed to influence sentiment and drive specific behaviour on behalf of particular groups.*

Last Friday I made a post which challenged the coordinated efforts of accounts who wanted to discourage the purchasing of GME shares; They **wanted** the stock price to end the week below $40 and pushed a conspiracy theory level, reverse psychology narrative, that there was some kind of emotional trigger attached specifically to $40 and that a wave of GME holders would dump their shares because they felt sad if people got their hopes up for the price to stay above $40. There was absolutely no evidence behind anything they claimed, but they **insisted** to people that it was true, and that it must be believed because anyone buying shares ‚Äúwas a shill‚Äù.

Ultimately they failed as GME holders rallied together in the final hours of trading; when the battle looked hopelessly lost in a manner similar to the invasion of Wakanda by the forces of Thanos , the light of the Bifr√∂st beamed down to reveal Keith Gill himself returning from the oblivion of congressional hearings and wielding another 50, 000 shares (as per DeepFuckingValue‚Äôs latest GME Yolo update on WallStreetBets).

The day closed out at $40.59 and after hours trading pushed that figure even higher. The people who claimed that hedge funds had spent all week engineering some kind of campaign aimed at ‚Äúmaking people feel sad when the price  definitely finishes below $40‚Äù looked like muppets. Everything they prophesied failed to manifest, and though they may claim they‚Äôre *happy it went back up*, the reality is their scaremongering was baseless and completely unhelpful. 

Within the midst of responses I received; whether the positive endorsements of renewed conviction other GME holders enthused, or the negative attempts of those spreading misinformation and accusations of somehow ‚Äúbeing a hedge fund shill‚Äù whose content was to be ignored for fear of the stock price going **UP**, one particular post stood out, and it‚Äôs one that has been on my mind in the days since:

&gt;I think it may have hit its peak when I bought shares, but I sure hope I‚Äôm wrong. I picked the wrong time to buy it. Now would have been a better time since it‚Äôs so low. I‚Äôm really bummed.

What I‚Äôm about to disclose in these posts will be an expansion of my initial reply to this redditor, because I know for sure that he isn‚Äôt the only one who could find himself questioning the choices he has made up until this point. With the burden and impact on all areas of our lives which correct or incorrect financial decisions can have, there can be profound consequences on our mental health that quickly cascade into our relationships with others, our professional careers, our personal ambitions and aspirations, and even our overall well being and happiness when an onslaught of negativity goes unchecked. With all that in mind, it‚Äôs important that we find the voice to stand tall against this.

In this series of posts, I‚Äôm going to break down all of the strategies that have been used to demoralise GME holders at all price points, so that by understanding the mechanisms, future attempts become insignificant. At the same time, everything I share will be supported by evidence and examples so that readers are encouraged to stay vigilant and use critical thinking toward their engagements - never accept the branding of something or someone without logical evidence to their claims.

The Art of War,"""Avoid what is strong and attack what is weak""¬†

Chu vs Wu


The mighty Chu kingdom launched an army to invade the small kingdom of wu. Wu being out number nearly 10 to 1 stands at a great disadvantage. The bigger Chu army expected the Wu to fortify its defense and dug in. Instead the wu's general, Sun Tzu, did the unexpected and went on the offensive. Sun tzu did not attack the chu army head on. He uses guerilla tactics, ambushes and surprise attacks. He attacked small outposts and camps, forcing the Chu army to chase and spread thin. With every skirmish sun tzu have a better understanding of his opponents. How they move, respond and think. Sun Tzu realizes he doesn't have to beat chu army. He just has to outlast them. Using guerrilla tactics he drained the chu army resources (food and gold) and most importantly political will. The chu army was force to retreat after the loss of morale and political will


""If you know yourself and your enemy, you need not fear the result of a hundred battle""

The battle of Red Cliff

Zhuge Liang of Shu vs Zhou Yu of Wu

The Shu and Wu army have joined forces to battle the mighty Wei army led by Cao Cao. Even Though wu and shu army are allies, Zhou yu, the Supreme commander of wu, knows that his shu counterpart zhuge Liang will be a thorn in the Wu side in the future. He devised a plan to get rid of zhuge Liang. He gave zhuge Liang an impossible task of making 100k arrows by noon on the 4th day. Zhuge Liang saw through Zhou Yu's plot but accepted the task anyway.¬†

For the next 3 days zhuge Liang did nothing causing Zhou yu to believe that zhuge Liang have given up. But on the third night as the fog roll in, Zhuge Liang order his men to prepare a fleet of small boats. He then ask the men to fill each boats with straw men. They then head off toward the Wei army. Under the cover of thick night fog, Zhuge Liang and his men approach the Wei fleet. Once they got within range zhuge Liang order his men to make noise. He knows that the Wei army will respond by shooting arrows at them. Zhuge Liang repeated this process a couple times before heading back to camp. Upon arrival at camp Zhuge Liang presented Zhou Yu with more than 100k arrows courtesy of the Wei army.¬†


""If your enemy is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is temperamental, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.""

The Gallic War

Julius Caesar of Rome vs Vercingetorix of Gaul

The¬† town of Alesia where vercingetorix of the Gaul have fortified his defense in preparation of a showdown with Julius Caesar of Rome. The Gaul army have implemented a scorched earth tactic in which they effectively took away the Rome army to secure more resources. Vercingetorix is also expecting more Gaul reinforcement. Vercingetorix know that time is on their side. They just need to hold out until reinforcement come and that would be the end of Julius Ceasars and the Roman army.¬†

But¬† Julius has a different idea. He decided to wallception their ass. He built 2 walls around the city of alesia. 1 inner and 1 outer wall effectively trapping vercingetorix army in and reinforcement out. What followed was a slaughter of the Gaul army.


What does Sun Tsu, Zhuge Liang, n Julius Caesar have in common? They refused to play their opponents game, instead play their own game

Just like¬† ü§≤üíéü¶ç. The shorts tried every tactic in the book , ladder attack, hide short, FUD, shills n bot, media attack. They have successfully played this game for years. You buy, they scare you and you sell.¬† Butü§≤üíéü¶ç refused to play their game. Instead of selling all the apes just buy more and hold. This has frustrated shorts to no end.¬†

The TRUE GAMER in All of Us! GMEStopped!,"I sometimes feel Congress is clueless however I believe Congress got this one totally accurate!

Everyone in the media deemed GME saga a David and Goliath story. I believe it is much more to Retail Investors! In following this Saga and Yes participating at a $14,500 clip. I read much more into the saga!

I find the campaign by the Hedgie mobs to be quite entertaining especially the attempts to get GME Apes to admit Manipulation! Typical thoughtless processing by the WS Elites! These so called Brilliant (in their own minds) Minds don‚Äôt understand that 99.9% of all remarks on Reddit are made just to get awards! 

Congress was right, people here think everything is a game! How do I know? Thanks for that great question! I am not from Bulgaria however I have 3 adult sons who are/would gladly spend $1,000+ just for the chance to play this adventure game; that is GMEStopped!
Disclaimer: I still have closets full of Video games bought at full price because well you must have it first! ($12,000 plus)

You the Hedgies, keep wasting your time but realize one major thing! the GAMERS Young/Old on this Reddit Sub are simply playing the game with you! 
You the hedge funds are losing huge! 

Realize this is not a Manipulation! This is simply A RAID on the villain in the game! The Diamond Hands will never relent especially when they see your Health Bar near Zero! The Diamond Handed Apes know that their HOLD Skill level is so Retarded
they will prevail! If one loses, typing /release will respawn them and the fight goes on! Learning from their mistakes, Apes will simply rise up and crush the villain!
NO MANIPULATION, JUST PURE WILLPOWER!

Hedgies have pissed off the Heroes of the Saga and they are rallying to their King: Roaring Kitty the DeepFuckingValue of our time! Hedgies tried to slay their King using the Media, Government and Real Manipulation tactics! There is nothing a TRUE GAMER hates more than  opponent who hacks the game using Cheat codes and illegal tactics taking advantages of small windows in the system! Like I always say:

Those Who Can DO, Those Who Can‚Äôt CHEAT!

I know all of this because I have been a TRUE GAMER since 1997 Ultima Online. I taught my sons everything they know, well almost everything! LOL

My advice Hedgies, Just PAY up and Move on, accepting you have been BEATEN! /release, /respawn and learn to fight another day!

- Was the line of questioning relevant to the GameStop issue? (I get that we should be concerned about China stealing our data, but what the fuck was Lee Zeldin even talking about?) 

- Did the questions provide information, gain insight, or establish a disputable claim? (Kenny was visibly shook when Vargas threatened to subpoena all of citadel) 

- Viral moments (‚ÄúHow many people are in the room with you right now?‚Äù)

- Blatant shills (McHenry received campaign donations from both Robinhood and Citadel. Not making any accusations yet, but it‚Äôs a lot to investigate and I can‚Äôt possibly dig through every politician‚Äôs dirty money ties)

- ‚ÄúSaved by the bell‚Äù (Some really interesting questions were asked with juuuust not enough time left, seems convenient)

- Are tangential subjects valuable if they help to establish congressional understanding of market mechanics? (T+2, transactional tax, interface gamification)

I don't believe this is the case. Look at the picture in the back ground. It's a cat with the phrase hang in there. He is saying that he is not the cat hanging in there. He is out. But it also said he, ‚Äúi like the stock.‚Äù which of course caused it to go up. It's apparent that he's not in the stock for it to go up. He's riding it down. Pumping it up and making money both ways. Or maybe just the way down. You got to look for the easter eggs. 


And maybe if someone says that they ‚Äúlike the stock‚Äù doesn't mean that they betting for it to go up. It can also mean that they are betting for it to go down. Especially in this case you can ride it up and ride it down if you go in at the right times.

The plan is simple.,"The plan is simple, hold and stay in unison with our conviction. Advertise that the stock is a good long-term investment, because it is and the fundamentals are there. This is literally the *only* way. I don't think we have an issue with holding, because lets face it we are too smooth-brained to do anything else. The problem is being in **unison** and **advertising** this stock.

I realize that being on a social platform makes it difficult but at least we have congregated to the oasis that is this subreddit, which is awesome because then important and relevant D.D. can be pushed from here to other corners of the Internet. Now imagine what it would be like if we didn't have to go against bots, shills, etc. The information would have spread much more organically and there would have been even more diamond hands and that would have been history. Reality is, every opportunity there is to dampen a fuse, they will take it. Any crack in the line they will seed FUD. One of their main objectives has been to divide and hope the energy fizzles out, just look at wsb. **Thus, maintaining a firm grasp of the long-term plan collectively will be enough to compromise this objective**.

As important as it is to hold and not give in, it's also important to bring attention to the general public. We are working uphill against an onslaught of negative press, I mean just look at how they portrayed DFV like he's a joke (he's my hero), meanwhile he was one of the most composed and professional during yesterdays hearing. They will not stop and they know it's working. Not only do they want us to be considered a joke they also want us to be painted as the enemy, i.e., the cause for people loosing their savings, meme stock mayhem, the potential downfall of the market, etc. This leads to a bunch of emotions that we smooth-brained apes can't process, but it makes other potential investors steer clear. The narrative is very much in their favor because they can play the mass media and GME stock like the fiddle, which for the most part is again creating a wall between us and those we need to like the stock. **Thus, we need to work hard to change the narrative and show people the long-term gme is worth it.**

Don't get me wrong, a lot of your have been working hard and are all incredibly inspiring. This is coming from am a deep lurker and reaching out to other deep lurkers to do their part. Keep it up!!! It's hammer time.",GME,1613762954,onecoffeetoolate,3,1,True,2021-02-19

But like all of you paint-chip eating mad-lads, I hold. I hold my 350 shares (@168) like the dipshit I am. I will Rick-Roll these mother fuckers into the portal of hell. Because at some point the Hedgies have to purchase them.

My strategy is this: I set a price to recover my seed money at $1,000 a share. I hold the rest. Forever. I want blood, I want screams, I want tearful billionaires crying as they disrobe and are forced to play with their nipples while I watch their pathetic OnlyFans videos for pennies an hour, eating my tendies. These people need to pay out the asshole for my remaining shares.

Don‚Äôt worry about this $40 share drop FUD today, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the Hedgies bring GME down to $2 a share. Let them. The fact is they still need my shares, next week or this Summer. Whatever.

Stay with me Tards, fire up the grill, and let us warm up our favorite snacks. This shit will get better every single day the stock sinks or rises.

How Low Can/Will GME Go Before We See A Turnaround?,"Hey Everyone,

So I have been following GME for some time now and got in with a couple hundred shares around the $100 mark. Since then we have all seen it spike up to $500 on one pre-market day and now we are below the $40 mark per share.

My question is, as I‚Äôm sure many people are thinking, when are we going to see a turnaround? Over the past few weeks we have seen so many posts saying ‚Äúhold the line at $80‚Äù, ‚Äúhold the line at $70‚Äù, ‚Äúhold the line at $60‚Äù, ‚Äúhold the line at $50‚Äù, ‚Äúgoing below $40 doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù, price doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù. And I‚Äôm not posting this to argue that those are the wrong sentiments. I just am curious what everyone is thinking in terms of this turning around and starting to see some positive uptick.

I get that volume is low, and HFs selling short back and forth is what is causing the price to drop, but at this rate what stops them from doing that till they run the share price into the ground and reach where they need the price to go?

I am down about 60%, so at this point I‚Äôm holding with üíéüôå either way. But I wanted to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on this.

Why you should hold,"My humble opinion and what do i trust.

I hold because i expect to:

&amp;#x200B;

1. - Hold until Earnings Report in March.

&amp;#x200B;

2.  ER in March:

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ Ryan Cohen announced as CEO.

¬∑ GME reports +500% online sales.

¬∑ GME reports 0.20$ gains by shares and projected +2.00$ in 3 years by conservative means.

¬∑ GME reports debt quality improvement to BB so Mutual Funds can buy it.

¬∑ Long term 5 years e-commerce plan.

¬∑ 0 shares dilution due to be able to finance themselves by credit (collateralizing RC¬¥s shares) or   
by issuing debt.

¬∑ Official SEC filing to change GME from retail to e-commerce ( final nail in coffin of the shorts).

&amp;#x200B;

Abso-fucking-lutely no way Ryan Cohen isn¬¥t cooking the biggest Reverse Uno card 5D chess play in the modern financial times.

The same guy which made himself billionaire competing against Amazon and creating thousands of US jobs and a +20 current capitalization company in less than 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

This is pure speculation, but you aren¬¥t here for regular investing; you are here to invest in the APPL post-.com bubble, where the company did have 0 trust from nobody, but a CEO which one day came in and view the world his company could fit in.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn¬¥t about money, i could have cashed out al a ten bagger.

This isn¬¥t about sticking in WS, because they will be hardly if any prosecuted; maybe Vlad does but Vlad is a ü§°ü§°ü§° even for his HFs friends.

This is about having commitment about something in live, this is about getting closer to the homeless person which is shivering in cold, and watching him and seeing and trusting and risking how much could be the very same entity, the very same person; in the future.

You just need to trust. But at this point so late in the game, why did you get it?

Was the squeeze? It isn¬¥t squoze, see the DD.

Is the long term? Excelent, wait until March to see what RC has been able to do in 2 quarters and judge in consecuence.

&amp;#x200B;

But I trully believe all of the above aforementioned will come to fruition sooner than later.

DFV stills see the stock as a buy, i see it as a buy.

Realistic price target for $GME during the peak of the squeeze.,"The reality of the situation is this is literally the second unprecedented event of all modern history. In my humble opinion, the first is the use of the a-bombs. 

My personal experience is, when you can‚Äôt believe a price has gotten that high, it is time to sell. I‚Äôve made hundreds of thousands of dollars using that strategy but I‚Äôve lost a similar amount by getting too greedy.

This is not anything that anyone can speak to with practical experience. Even the Great VW squeeze of 2008 where the share price exceeded $1,000 dollars so the company was the most valuable in the world, won‚Äôt be but a star in the great sky which is $GME. 

Why? Because of the sincerity of not only the OGs that thought it was a good trade on a global level, that didn‚Äôt exist with VW, but because of the hydra-esque juggernaut which is 

1- righteousness 
2- social media
3- whales
4- retarded ü¶ç 
5- üíé üôå 
6- coverage (good, bad, international, congressional, quant funds)
7- the enormous amount of Titans around us in the form of silent activist investors

Brother and sister ü¶ç, we have an opportunity before us to set the scales equal to where they should be. Don‚Äôt squander it and sell for what you think is good enough, use your Pure Imagination except for chocolate, diamonds. 

https://youtu.be/SVi3-PrQ0pY

No one can pretend to guess the price but as you think to sell, remember the injustice that we have had to endure for tar too long. 

In all reality, the peak price SHouLd  be several orders of magnitude higher than that of VW in 2008

A word to the wise about removing margin from an E-trade account,"Let me try and save you a phone call just in case...
I called my broker, E-trade, yesterday evening to remove margin access from my account. Was on hold for an hour to get to the first person, and then an hour to get to a ""trader"". Somehow I was only able to get an assistant trader or something but he was nice enough to keep me on the line while he got me through to a trader with enough authority to remove margin from my account. After waiting on hold for almost 2-1/2 hours here's what he told me. 

""In order to remove margin from your account you need to have two things:
1: No outstanding margin (G2G!)
2: No trades that have not settled (üò∞ takes 2 days and I had just bought more)""

So I was unable to remove margin from my account but he was nice enough to schedule a callback for Thursday morning when my trade is supposed to be settled.

Make sure you have those two items covered and you'll be golden. Minus the possible 2-3 hour wait. (I just put it on speaker and let it play that wonderful elevator music)

Hope this helps!

TL;DR - need to have no outstanding margin or unsettled trades before you call to remove margin.

Please be responsible.,"Fellows holders, the price of GME is disconnected from the reality, I always trust the chart, but in this situation it makes no sense, and don't rely on any stupid technical analysis, because the price is disconnected from the real market, all shits happened this month, manipulation - ladder attack - hiding shares - and many dirty things we might don't know yet.

I have no idea what is the real price of GME right now it could be 200$ or more or less, but absolutely not 50, not even 45! have a faith they are losing BIG and we are winning BIG! they are trying to use anything to win, but they are dreaming in unlimited heaven but the reality is they are falling in abysmal HELL! I'm very sure from now on it's not investing, it's a battle between us and them, they are using SEC and some paid political figures to sue DFV and us and they might even halt buying for days or maybe weeks! trust me it's a dirty war and they key of winning is to keep holding, the SEC is doing as the third world doing everyday to FUCK their citizens and protect the elite! in the 3rd world they arrest anyone for any reason they want, not necessary if you did something or not, your destiny is to go to jail, now SEC is trying to fuck anything, Look how did they sued Ripple!!! WTF now GameStop and DFV! I doubt if they understand what is the stock market or even what is the blockchain tech, they take orders and blindly obey..

Remember in the big short,"SCION holdings were -19% and was dropping because the fallout that they are hoping for did not come in the time that they expected. Actually, it kept going up. and up and up. they thought this shouldn't be the case. 

the media, other analysts, other banks were telling them that it won't crash that it will continue to go up. Media tried to put fake news and banks were doubling down.

No amount of lies will change what they need to do. if you think that there are missing shares which we have proof of, if you think that they are shorting GME and other ETFs holding GME, if you think that alot of people are buying yet price is going down, if you think that the majority of stakeholders are still holding on and believes in this company - then hold. if you don't, then sell it. if you do sell, you DONT need to tell us. I mean whats the point? make this decision yourself. Nobody is here to tell you what to do. 

You should not have regrets with what you will decide to do. I know i will regret it if instead of holding, down the line, the squeeze happens. I would think ""man, the DD's told me everything about this stock and I paperhanded JUST because the price went down."" We are at the -19% of Scion capital right now.

Possible explanation on the reason for the lower then normal price,"Now just as a quick forward, I'm not nearly as educated on these things as are the other DDers. However, from what I've been reading I think there is an explanation for the lower then normal share prices.

We know that the hedges are able to trade stocks amongst themselves at certain prices to drive the price down. However, they didn't have the volume of shares amongst themselves to get it any lower then around $50. 

Could it be that the reason they can now drive it down towards $40 is because there are more people jumping on the GME train using RH and other finnicky brokers that lend out shares?

If we assume that the more shares available to the hedges, the more they can drive the price down, then it wouldn't make sense that they could all of a sudden begin laddering it down even further out of nowhere. But if more people were jumping on again but using brokers like RH who lend shares out, wouldn't that theoretically provide more shares to the hedgies to borrow which they could then use to drive the price down further?

It's just a hunch, and I wouldn't know where to look to confirm this, but I wanted to see what you all thought.",GME,1613590457,Boutaround,36,1,True,2021-02-17

Going deep with DFV's Monstars Tweet,"First off, I just want to say that this will be the insane ramblings of a ü¶ç with too little sleep and too much caffeine. There is nothing serious about this at all. Second, I'm not going to repeat what many people have already put forward as their interpretation.

So, here goes.

In thinking about the tweet, one of the Monstars characters stood out to me. BLANKO. This is the tall skinny one second from the left. Doing a deep dive into this specific character, some things stuck out to me.

On [https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Monstars#Members](https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Monstars#Members), Blanko is described as:

&gt; He is friendly to Michael Jordan and Tweety. He speaks in a thick californian accent. 

Blanko is also voiced by Steve Kehela. Now, if you look at the people who will testify tomorrow, you'll see that the only person named Steve is Steve Huffman, CEO &amp; Co-founder of Reddit.

On top of this, Blanko stole the powers of Shawn Bradley. If you do an image search of Shawn Bradley and Steve Kehela, you'll notice an eerie similarity.

What my sleep deprived flight of fantasy is making me imagine is that DFV will not be alone tomorrow. There will be a Monstar that is actually friendly to all of us wonderful ü¶ç.

More Than Meets The Eye,"I don't just mean the market, and HFs, and everything else we have been talking about. There's more at play here than just the financial industry as we know it.

No. You have to think... What happens when all these bots and shills are wrong? What happens when all these bought off analysts and pundits reddit bots are wrong? What happens when credibility is on the GME Long position again?

I think (and we all know this) the GME saga is uncovering something much bigger. People are looking at us like some crazy conspiracy theorists, and that's only because we don't have access to real News Outlets that can effectively tell the story. When there is a redistribution of wealth, the derivative effects will be astronomical... People will have the opportunity to open businesses, send their kids to prestigious universities, get involved with politics, become pillars of their communities, and so on... So what does that mean for the HFs and Manipulators **that** happens?

History is written by the victors and when this saga is complete, we will have the means to tell the story and that changes **everything.**

They're trying so hard to keep a noose on GME and the story because this is beyond just halting trades. If there are bots attempting to sway sentiment on these threads and elsewhere... how long has it been happening? If we are seeing low-volume plays meant to drive down stocks... how long has it been happening?

I am not an advisor and a simple Ape among you, but I think this is much bigger than the squeeze or what will happen to GME in the next 5 years. This is big and it's exposing the glut and corruption that has been hidden from most people forever.

If change does not happen tomorrow or in the next few years, I guarantee these young Apes will not rest until they have made change within the system when they start swinging their Harambe Dicks in Congress, the Senate, and in Private Business.

Anecdotal evidence for GameStop's future under Ryan Cohen,"Most understand you shouldn't go full boar into using anecdotes to support your claims. However, with the weekend and Presidents day I couldn't help but notice some things I felt like sharing. 

A close friend of mine got into Gamestop stock without ever going onto Reddit. He delivers for a postal service and has always noticed how many Chewy boxes he delivers. When Ryan Cohen joined the board, he bought some GME because he knew how successful Cohen had been with Chewy and it felt like a no brainer because of the packages he'd delivered. No Reddit, no hype, just personal experience. 

I work a job were I often go to people's homes, since this has started and I have been an investor in GME, I have noticed Chewy boxes at a significantly large amount of homes that have pets. To say this hasn't got me excited in the middle of a work day would be an understatement. 

Beyond that, most homes tend to have video games and PC's as well. This doesn't even include pop-culture merchandise and a ""million"" other potential avenues.

Some Off-Day Thoughts and Takeaways,"Reposted from comments in the daily discussion.


First and foremost, I am not a financial expert and this is certainly not financial advice, but with it being a slow day with no ticker to be continuously refreshing I thought it would be a good time to share my takeaways on the GME saga thus far. 

 1. GME related or not, always do your homework. It is obvious at this point that false information and narratives are being tossed around like beads at Mardi Gras. If you learn nothing else from this situation when all is said and done, it should be to not take ANYTHING at face value even if it comes from what you previously thought was a reputable source. Understand who is saying it and more importantly why they are saying it. Be able to read between the lines. 

 2. This is not over. Again, this should be so obvious that it doesn't need to be said but here we are. If it was over, you would know. 

 3. Nobody knows when the rocket will launch, so stop asking. Everybody knows we are primed for takeoff, but making predictions as to when and how high it will go does not help. Just sit tight and enjoy the ride. 

 4. We all know that FUD is everywhere trying to convince you that the ship has sailed, but on what basis? DD goes both ways, positive and negative.

To the Mods &amp; members: Can I Be Serious For A Moment? There's toxicity brewing..... I got nothing but love for most of you but.....,"As much as I like GameStop, GME and even this sub I've noticed over the past few weeks that this sub and many others involving stocks have become compromised. I'm not saying the mods here have betrayed anyone. No it's some of the members. I posted a week or so ago that our subs were being invaded by Wall Street Rats and the Hedge Funds. Ever since the GME squeeze r/wallstreetbets has been bombarded with members, suffered a coup and even as I post this are facing unwarranted ridicule.

I've commented on posts here who's sole objective is spreading hatred towards and separation from r/wallstreetbets. Many of these comments are by members salty because their comments are getting moderated and/or they're getting banned. Instead of getting the facts of the entire situation from the source they're riding the coattails either the wall street spies or the childish imbeciles acting on anger and rage. 

People were unifying regardless of political affiliation, race, gender identity, country or religious beliefs. The 1% and even the government took notice. Now regardless of why or how it happened GME AMC BB BBBY NOK made it happen. I was loving the unity like a kid on Christmas that got everything he/she wanted. I was loving it almost as much as the day my son was born. Do I'm sure many of you will understand how I feel watching as these entities invade our subs spreading misinformation while using separation tactics (successfully)

It's disheartening to see how weak willed and gullible many in the Reddit community is. Folks clearly missing the fact that separation is a form a manipulation (like illusions) 

With all that I've said here I've respectfully decided to take a break from r/GME due to the influx of hatred and WSB bashing. Anyone wishing to seriously reach me, (mods included)feel free to hit my inbox but be forewarned I'll report and block any and all disrespect. I have severe anger issues (I don't like to halt my anger, which can be problematic) which is the main reason. Some might be thinking ""Oh well!...Bye"" I can see the memes already. My response to them is ""With all due respect. Go get rectally rammed with a glass covered d*ldo""

Fuck any and all Wall Street Rats, Hedge Fund Snakes &amp; Corrupt Politicians working against us including but not limited to the SEC. 

To the members here who've show love and respect, I want you to know you have my love and respect in return.

How GameStop takes over the earth.,"So I have been thinking about GME way too much latley and came up with a really QAnon kinda dumb but fun ""it is all connected"" theorie. Let me point out beforehand that I don't actually believe this is true but I still think its fun enough to think about.

&amp;#x200B;

So what if GME is a long planned and coordinated attack on the Wall Street as a revenge to the 2008 financial crisis and actually change the world to the better.

&amp;#x200B;

Just some things that came to my mind. In 2008 hedge founds found a way to exploit the system to make millions of peope poor and get away with it. What if someone found a way to prevent this from happening again.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2009 Bitcoin was created. One year after the crisis. No one knows by whom. It takes 11 years to get Bitcoin to 40.000$/c. Under it lies a mathematical algorithm that seems to be rewarding to hold the Coin.   
Everyone knows about Bitcoin. Trader or nontrader. It's astronomical rise makes people desentized to big numbers. 40.000 is reachable. Its right there. One or two tickers away from whatever your second favorite stock to look at is right know. That is not hat 40.000$. But should be. Because I like the stock.

Corona crisis hits. I don't think it was planted but sooner or later something like this had to come just by chance alone. The market first seems to crash but after that it goes up faster than ever before. More and more people get into trading. They have nothing to do with their time and their money.  


Some people saw it coming long ago. DFV was one of them. There was never market manipulation. But its just like evolution. It was out there for everyone to see, what shorts were doing. But more and more people were noticing. And GME slowly began its rise from what should have been a dead company. And then a spark hit r/wsb and more and more people jumped on the train.

Jan 2021, GME is shorted more than a 100%, just out there for everyone out to see. So I decide to like the stock.

&amp;#x200B;

***you are here***

&amp;#x200B;

GME becomes a ticking time bomb. Price is dropped and people should be selling but they are not. They keep buying insteead. This fight continiues for months. But interests keep getting higher. Shorts try to break free, they build up bigger and bigger bubbles to trough people off.  
They don't suceed.  
GME shows its Q4 numbers which exeeds expectations by a huge amount because all of the positiv publicity GameStop was getting and people started to notice that they have an online shop with an cotalogue that is actually quite good. GME fires the booster and goes to a 1000 where its is hit heavily by shorts again. The attack was at planned at this highpoint where many people would expect others to sell. But they are not. Apes are not satisfied with 1.000 Bananas. Ape want more. Another wave hits and catapults GME past 100.000 leaving Bitcoin in its shadow. The squeeze who was promised has been deliverd. 

GameStop is know the most valuable company in the world. Gaming is the future. Gaming comes out of the living room and into the faces of everyone. There will be Olympic E-Games where all countries send their best players of selceted games to compete against each other. Gaming will be the biggest market in the entire world. It will unite people of all ages, nationalities and religions. And all under one Banner.

GME

The world has become a better place.

I finally sell of 1 Stock of GME, invest half of my earinings in Bitcoin and with the rest I buy Teslas for all my friends.   
Elon Musk and Ryhan Cohan are the richest people on earth and Wall Street is trapped in ever bigger getting waves until they are swollowed whole.

Money is power and know power was come to the players.

Only Robin Hood failed this time.

I finally I get some Tendies.

Let's talk about sell limits. RESEARCHERS NEEDED,"Hey there everyone. In the past few days I've been noticing that more and more brokerages are not allowing sell limits above 10%, 50%, 100%, etc. above the current share price for ""certain securities"" (ie GME). 

I've ALSO seen multiple screenshots (the most recent one was schwab, I'll link it here if I can find it) of brokerages saying they CANNOT put a sell limit in place because there are ZERO shares held. Aka your shares are lent out and now they wont let you put in a sell limit in place because they cannot find your shares. 

This makes me nervous. In the event of a squeeze, this practice employed by brokerages could end up burning retail, and we aren't really talking about it. Imagine a scenario where GME moons, you decide that you'd like to collect your $69,420, $77,777, $88,888, $100,000/share, or whatever else your sell price may be, and then your brokerage goes ""oopsie! lost your shares teehee"". Heartbreaking. We would have held through all of this bullshit just to be kneecapped at Valhalla. 

Therefore, we need to figure out ways for this not to happen. As of now, the only brokerage I know of that is allowing sell limits at whatever price you see fit is Vanguard. I have a hunch most of us are not using Vanguard. 

If I could guess, RH users are probably the most exposed to this risk, for obvious reasons. But I don't think we are all safe if we are off RH. Take my brokerage, TDA, for example. Right now I can't set a sell limit higher than $300/share. Bullshit. Who are they to tell me what I would like to sell my shares for? I've read that there are ways to set higher limits through conditionals, but here is where my worry comes in: conditionals do not ensure that your brokerage won't loan your shares!!!!! They only go into effect *once your conditional requirements are met*. Lets think that one through. By the time a conditional requirement for a sell limit in the range of 6 figures per share is met, who is to say that your shares will be able to he found at that point in time? If they aren't found, well then you are basically fucked. 

What can we do about this? I can't imagine the amount of pain and heartbreak a scenario like this would cause. It would be literally the worst possible scenario, being sidelined to watch everyone else cash the fuck out while you are locked out from shady brokerage practices. We need to make sure EVERYONE has a plan and a way to put sell limits in place BEFORE this all goes down. The way I see it, with the lengths they have gone to, there really is no stopping how far they are willing to go to make sure we end up losing. I really think we are going to need to do some serious brainstorming around this because with the new findings about XRT and institutional holdings, coupled with the possibility of retail owning more than 50% of GME, I think the chances of a squeeze happening are nonzero, and therefore, the chances of this scenario happening are also nonzero. If we can brainstorm a way that everyone can put in a safe sell limit instead of a conditional, I think we all will find ourselves in a better place come the day of the squeeze.

**NOTE:** I am in no way advocating for a particular price target. This post is to ensure we all have a way to sell at the value we each personally think our shares are worth. I in no way am advocating for us all settling on a particular price, nor am I giving investment advice.",GME,1613421418,sci_comes_1st,40,1,True,2021-02-15
I just want to thank this sub for all the amazing support and work. You guys don't even know how much this is positively affecting my life. Moon or not. ‚ù§,"Hi guys! I really wanted to take the time today to show my sincere appreciation for what this community has brought me in these difficult times, money is simply a bonus. 

Shortly after the first shut down in Canada back in march 8th, my 6 years relationship abruptly ended. It was a mess, the cops were involved and the whole neighborhood could hear us. The breakup was long overdue and frankly, I am glad it's over. He was an abusive piece of shit. I lost count off how many times the cop came over after or during a fight. I never said anything, he has a criminal record and I didn't want risking him going to jail. No matter how much money I made it was never enough. We were always struggling financially. He usually can't keep a job more then 6 months and it usually takes 2 months + before he lands a new job. There was times when I had to juggle between 3 jobs doing 80hrs/week so we can makes end meet. We had such a reckless life style which went against my deepest values. I was so unhappy but he made me feel like I would be nothing without him. 

Before I met him, I had 12K in my RRSP a good credit and my debt althought high, was managable. However, it became unmanagable when I had to take on his shit and all our comon bills ( they were all under my name...). Around year 3, I had to do a consummer proposal because shit hit the fan and it was the only way out. I also got a dossier at the rental board because again, everything is under my name. I feel that that relationship took every positive thing about me and gave me a bag of crap in return. 

I lived in a woman's shelter for 5 months before deciding to go back living under my parents's roof. I left at 20 and came back at 32 I feel like a total looser right now. I consider myself a pretty ret4rd but sometimes, like once in a blue moon, I can be fucking 4utistic. That, my deer ape friends is the only thing that has kept me semi sane. And the only reason why I am still able to have a sliver of faith in myself. It's fucking hard I will not lie to you. I am battling crazy ptsd and currently doing 2hrs/ week therapy. 

My parents are uneducated immigrant who moved to Canada after the Vietnam war. We are poor and rely on the gov to help us. My biggest dream / wish is to be able to provide a good life for them. Instead, here I am depending on their support. Seriously I am still having a hard time with this. I smoke a shit ton of weed to calm my all time high general anxiety. However my parent are FOB (fresh out the boat) as f*ck guys. They haven't progress mentally so for them weed is super shun apon. Althought I do love my parent very much we don't always, almost never, see eye to eye. I feel guilty smoking when it is the only thing that helps me right now. That being said, I know this situation is temporary and there is also upside about me living with my parent. I've been on a work leave since march. At first it was due to lock down but now it is simply because I am physically not ready to go back to work. I am still recovering from my burn out. 

I thought I met someone special but since the beginning of this week he's been ghosting me. I am still feeling the pain from the last relationship so right now, it truly feels like a double heart break. I don't have much friends and I'm not a big texter or phone conversationner. I'm a loner really, I know it's not good when you have depression and it's something I'm still working on. 

Facebook for me is more a repertoir for articles and journals to satisfy my thirst for information more then a place I follow friends. Thats how I first heard of GME during it's peak. I bought on the way down in the lower 3 digits. I always wanted to dabble in trading so when I read about GME, I got curious. The reason why I join was to fully support the movement. I always love to stirr shit up and this shit need some stirring my fellow apes. I remember buying the first 2 shares while shouting viva la revolution. We all know what happened to the price next üòÖ. It didn't matter to me. I don't have much knowledge about how all this stuff works but just enough to understand the basic gist of it. I quickly joined r/WSB and read some great DD. So I kept buying as the price keep going down üòÇ. However it's not when mass media started to push silver that I really saw how things are twisted. That's when my curiosity really got wet. Soon after I discover r/GME. Now I hold alot more shares that I previously planned 10X more and adding more when the market opens tomorrow. 

I am mostly depress, I have lost my apetite which sucks because next from sex and making money eating is my joie de vivre.¬† Finding GME is a pure blessing. I have never felt so much part of a group like this before. Which is fucking insane because I don't even know how any of you looks like and sound like. During the trading days, I wake up at 8h30 fully awake and ready to pound my chest and looking for bananas (the real ones, my new morning bfast). While before GME, IF I wake up at 11am that's considered early and I don't eat until my stomach hurts. I get so excited opening up my browser and looking at the price going up and down knowing it's all shenanigans. Reddit is the absolute highlights of my day. It gives me something to look forward to. The insane support this community has and the fucking attidude is AZM. I don't know how I would of manage my depression and anxiety and heart ache without GME and this community. I grew up playing video games and it was such an important part of my life. So supporting GME goes way beyond money. Like I said, it is delicious bonus. And if by some fuckup way I loose all my money, I wouldn't care. The memes in itself was worth the money. I haven't laughed so hard and felt so alive in the past couple weeks that I ever had in the past decade. 

I think the whole valentine things is getting to me more then I realized.üòÖ

"Just remembers, no matter what happens this week or the next, this is a LONG game.","Long relatively speaking of course. If the squeeze doesn‚Äôt happen this week or next, don‚Äôt lose hope. The longer this goes on, the better for us. Monkey hold banana because monkey like banana. Simple.

They‚Äôre going to get our hopes up for a squeeze, and then crush it. You‚Äôll only be crushed if you fall for their tactics. Here‚Äôs some things to look forward to.

1. Congressional hearing as a potential catalyst. The amount of publicity will be insane. Hopefully DFV can set the record straight.

2. Earning call late March for GameStop. Ryan Cohen is a competent man. He will have a vision and a future in sight for GameStop. Trust it. This could lead to shorts covering, cause why would you bet against this man? 

Those are just two big things out of a vast realm of possibility. Any big whale could join in and shake things up. Just be patient. Patience wins. Remember that Warren Buffet quote.

"Before any rockets launch, learn how to handle money well so your life WILL be changed if we fly past the moon.","This post is something I hope everyone on this forum reads BEFORE the stock goes through the roof. The reason this is so important is because over 80% of lottery winners are bankrupt within a decade of winning. 

If you have a job, please take a few weeks/months before you quit, and take that time to learn how to handle money well. Learn to budget, save, invest (properly), and do the right thing with money.

How I see it is GME is like that Lottery game that a couple did the math and found out they could promise winnings...so they risked their house and everything to buy as much as they could. Profit 80k. They did it again and again until the had made millions from it. Then they began helping their whole town grow their money until the game closed down.

GME is one of those things. It‚Äôs still a gamble, but all the math and DD that I‚Äôm seeing points to it being inevitable to go up. Idk if that‚Äôs 5k, 12k, or 69,420/share...but I BELIEVE that it will go up.*

Learn now what to do with your money, make a plan NOW, and then shoot for that goal. I‚Äôd recommend looking up a tax pro before you transfer your funds from fidelity (or other platform) to your bank account.

Were on to something here boys. Notice how the [MASSIVE DROP](https://imgur.com/a/oSlgKXv) in GME shorts correlates exactly with the peak short of XRT-- which was shorted over 800% of float that day. Hedge funds bought to cover their GME shorts while simultaneous shorting XRT, which is an ETF that contains GME. They bought long positions in all stocks contained in the ETF to stay NET SHORT GME.

A true autists DD on why r/wallstreetbets is forever shit,"Ok autists. Listen. I've been doing a lot of thinking about r/wallstreetbets and the shit going on with Gamestop and its effects on the various communities. 

To add a quick interject of experience, I'm a one year trader who found wsb about three/four months ago, loved the loss porn, and got really taken for a ride with the whole GME experience.

I've been thinking about the different groups and how WSB was before and after. I only ever saw WSB as 'advice' until during and after GME. Again, wsb was a casino. It was for idiots to throw cash at a yolo and MAYBE. MAAAAAYYBEE. Make money. It was to see idiot kids and even more retarded adults throw a 1/50 lottery ticket. If you want 1/5 literally take the years to become an investor. It's hard. The adage 'if it was easy everyone would do it' remains true here.

Now I think people are starting to look at WSBs as real investing. Which if you're doing stop right now. The weed yolo is an example of scaling. GME took about 2-3 weeks for major media and the investing world to catch on. Weed took 2-3 days. The next one will be hours. People are watching r/wallstreetbets. And eyes will stay on for at least a year. Deep money will not take money off of sending a few bots to pick out the top mentioned, or even just a list of all, stock tickers for a least a decade. WSB is over. The hedgefunds learned their lesson. And if they somehow are the assininely stupid give them 2-3 more. You need to find something new if you want what wsbs gave you. Something they have not thought of, are not looking at, or have not thought to look for. Nothing less will have their eyes on it.

"The thing we all missed from the ""Meet Kevin"" interview.","I'm gonna start by saying I'm not a bot or a shill,  just a long time lurker,  and also that I'll hold my GME to the grave before I lock in a loss.
So we all watched the Meet Kevin interview with the CEO of M1 finance right?  The thing that I haven't seen anyone talking about is the implication that the clearing houses themselves are the entity that broke the momentum and gave the hedgies time to cover.  The reason given is so the clearing houses themselves wouldn't be liable for the financial spillover of short positions if the hedge funds go completely bankrupt.  If that happened,  and happened enough,  say GME actually hit $69,420 while short interest was still above 80%,  we actually potentially could have bankrupted the DTCC,  the NYSE and NASDAQ.  For obvious reasons these regulating bodies will do anything in their power to prevent their own bankruptcy.  With that in mind,  I no longer expect any meaningful second squeeze to happen.
I do however believe in GME as a company,  and see a bright future ahead with massive profits for even the $350 gang if they can hold through Gamestops transition.  I also believe that we need to take a much closer look at clearing houses massive conflict of interest in being financially liable for short sales,  and their ability to tamper with trading to prevent that financial liability.  
TL;DR the stock market itself might collapse if the MOASS happens and the people on the hook for that debt have the ability to prevent that from happening.  I'm holding for the future of $GME,  not for the short squeeze.  
I hopped on the train late and in the middle of a bad spot financially,  so I'm only holding 4@152,  but I believe in this company and I like the stock.  
Disclaimer,  none of this is financial advice,  I am not a financial advisor,  and I prefer to melt my crayons and eat them like a thick soup with a fancy porcelain spoon.

The data lists all short transactions for the month **by day and time** including the *number of stocks shorted* and at what *dollar amount* which gives you enough data when combined with the historic high/low to determine if it was possible for a short to be covered in a given timeframe.

I really believe in Ryan Cohen and I love the three big hires that they made recently. If Cohen can really transform/innovate GameStop in the next 5-7 years, I have really high expectations for the company/business. This will change everything. I can see Cathie Wood adding GME to her ETFS in the future if Cohen and co takes GME in the right direction. ARKK already has 4.3 million shares of Nintendo stock and another 1.1 million shares of Nintendo in ARKW. ARKW has 1.4 million shares of Skillz. GME could and should be bigger than Nintendo and Skillz under Cohen.

Some words of reassurance.,"**Position:** 8 shares @ 220 avg. Bought some on the higher end before RH blasted us.

Mostly writing this to get my own thoughts out as well as to try and give people some strength.

Hey. Take it easy. Deep breaths. Breathe.

Let's say you were a responsible investor and only put in money into GME you could afford to lose. Notice that key word- afford to lose. We'll all go back to our normal lives, assuming there's no catalyst. That's okay. For a lot of us, that means we'll still have food to eat, clothes on our back, and roofs over our heads. That's a lot better than tons of people out there.

If you put money in that you couldn't afford to lose...that's on you. Nobody ever says that's a good idea and for good reason.

Let's assume that **the money we put into GME is gone.** Why? This is why.

If you accept that money is gone, the FUD has no impact. Keep in mind, you'll still have a great life. Nothing has fundamentally changed. That number can go all the way down to $5- so what? **Our intention to buy and hold the stock has never changed.** We're not selling the stock- we're simply accepting that money as having vanished. **Our diamond hands still own the stock.**

**Nothing has fundamentally changed in your life, nor the reason you bought this stock.** I still wholeheartedly believe that the GME squeeze will happen. I'm very bullish on that. The only thing we need to is wait and be patient, right? But that's easier said than done. As much as I'd like to think otherwise, being surrounded by so much FUD has definitely done a number on me, and I'm sure the same feeling is there for a lot of you.

Let's reconsider the facts here. **Our DD hasn't changed. We want to hold the stock because we like the stock. It can go as low as it wants, but that's okay. We have our shares, and we're not selling at a loss.** 

Now, really take a moment to consider why you feel sad. For me, it was because I really feel shorted- no pun intended. I feel like an opportunity to make a lot of money that could have changed my life was taken away from me unfairly. If I lost this money because of my own stupidity, I'd take the L and keep moving. That's not what happened. That frustration is why I still bought at dips to average down and hold more. 

If you're like me, consider this- **there's no sense in getting worked up about losing something you never had in the first place.**

GME squeeze? Yeah. I think it'll happen. I know it will. The fact is, however, our morale is taking a beating. But the more the stock plummets, the more paperhands are shaken out. There is still plenty of appropriate catalysts that can occur. If they do, great. If not...hey. I meant it when I said 0$ or $10k+. Did you?

**Stay strong, apes and apettes. We have lost nothing. We stand to gain everything. The only we we'll lose is if we let go of our shares. üôåüíé**

All we need to do is help our fellow comrades. Encourage and keep our spirits high. Focus on DD and maintain your positions. This won't be easy, but nothing worth earning is. We can do this.

**For the purposes of maintaining said morale, feel free to link DD that keeps you going. I'll be adding and editing the post with links.**",GME,1612901429,TheNoshman13,0,1,True,2021-02-09

ü§≤üíéü§≤ WHY I'M GOING TO HOLD GME ü§≤üíéü§≤,"Is this the biggest cover up going on in the history of Wall Street? 

Finra reports 78% Short Interest on GME but there is a huge problem. Data suggests that over 147% of short interest were covered while people were buying more and more GME. Platforms are reporting there is over 80-90% buying happening with GME. Where did they find millions of share to cover? Volume from last 3 days were 62m, 25m, and 26m. Price has fallen significantly during low volume days, however there were huge volumes on the days that price jumped. 

Most important question here is:
Why did they pay $300+ to purchase shares on a day that SP trading at $59? If there were enough shares, if they have really dropped the short volume then they should've found shares at few $ more than the trading price NOT $300/share to buy back. 

Also don't forget that in the past reports were falsified, because reporting a huge short interest will spark interest and get the rally going soon. Always remember Wall Street share trading is a RIGGED game. Jim Cramer said you tell the public the opposite thing to the fact to stop the market from moving.  

If they can naked short a stock more the float, if they can get all trading platforms to shut down, if they falsified the reports in the past, if the whole thing is rigged WHY WOULD I  TRUST THE REPORT THAT COMES FROM ONE OF THEM? They will only get few millions in fines comparing to losing billions in short position. So the cost effective method is lie on the report. 78% short interest a whole lot of bananas to buy back anyway. 

I decided to HOLD, the squeeze hasn't happened based on my research. Also keep in mind that institutional buyers like BlackRock are loading this , and currently institutional ownership sits above 200%. Why? They know what this worth in days, weeks, month and years.

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,"TLDR: Hard to distill it into TLDR but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in GME (and there is strong evidence to support that theory). I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling**.‚Äù

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance"" and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù** Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äú**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman‚Äôs words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‚Äò**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price‚Äô**‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚Äú**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Edit: Someone asked ""so what‚Äôs the current short position? Looks like they some how covered?""

Pasting my response below because I'd like people to see:

I've heard people say 78%, thats still a high number, but personally I made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today. Correct me if I'm wrong, that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position. Apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrist/a small fine. I also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with, more on that on my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/).

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3,"Reposting because for whatever reason once this post started gaining traction in r/stocks it was removed.

**r/stocks reactivated the post, I posted this in several places please comment there as it has the most opinions to go around and I‚Äôm not jumping all over the place**

Hello all,

Before I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.

I would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.

I also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.

This brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.

When I say ""it"" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, ""it"", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.

Millions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.

To examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:

1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.
2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.

I think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.

1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.
2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.
3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.
4. Some combination of the above 3.

**First, the data:**

Based on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.

[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%

This spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including ""synthetic longs"" introduced by S3.

It is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.

Let's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:

**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**

What's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.

That would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. 

**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**

Again, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. 

I think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. 

Again, we fall into a ""what-if"" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.

**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**

This scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.

If the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. 

Sadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. 

There are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.

**Some combination of the above 3.**

Truthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many ""what-if's"" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.

Now, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. ""It's two weeks old"". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.

I will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.

Today's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.

**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) ""The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.""

The exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.

**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless

**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.

**03/05 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the ""dying brick and mortar"" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.

I have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes ""just happen"". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**

I hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.

Normally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.

I digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), was at the time ""inevitable"" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.

I want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.

**SO WHAT DO I THINK**

I think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. 

42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. 

How would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:

1. Close early and take profits
2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.

In the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.

To break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. 

**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.

**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**

My though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:

1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.
2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air
3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. 

It is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.

**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**

Well, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Mid March-ish), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.

Thank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from ""get over it, the squeeze happened"" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.

Thanks for your time

**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**

**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline.

In fact, I know nothing about any of this shit so if you listen to me or take anything I say as financial advice you're a real dumb fuck. I offer no advice, financial or otherwise. However, I have seen others guesstimate that if the HFs holding shorts have to liquidate it would result in a fund of billions resulting in share prices of like $20k - $30k... truly mind-boggling numbers that make my pp go üçÜ. In a situation like that, HFs would sell their mother's left nut to buy your stock at $1k, $5k, hell anything is a bargain to cover their shorts at that point.

So even when/if the üöÄ takes off, apes with diamond hands will go to outer space. Paper hand bitches will be letting the HFs off easy.

TLDR: **Data points strongly point to Hedge Funds using tricks to appear as if they covered their shorts when they haven't truly covered, specifically an illegal method/loophole to ""cover"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options**. Full details below.

There‚Äôs an insightful piece on [TradeSmithDaily](https://tradesmithdaily.com/investing-strategies/the-drop-in-gamestop-short-interest-could-be-real-or-deceptive-market-manipulation/) that identifies two ways for both short interest and price to fall quickly.

The first scenario is from retail investors not holding the line and panic selling, driving the price down further, releasing into the market more of the float and enabling shorts to cover/buy back shares at progressively lower levels.

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

Plummeting short interest along with a plummeting GME share price, in other words, could indicate that the Reddit army is headed for the hills, and the longs were selling early, giving the shorts a means to cover, as the longs got out‚Ä¶ Important to note that if the long holders of GME shares did not break ranks and sell en masse, it would have been impossible for the share price to fall and hedge fund short interest to fall at the same time. because, without a critical mass of long-side holders selling into the market, the hedge funds covering their shorts would have nobody to buy from as they covered (bought back) their short positions.

\*\*

The second scenario is where hedge fund short interest in GME didn‚Äôt really dissipate but instead they played a trick to make it seem like it did, demoralizing the retail side and further ‚Äúbreaking the squeeze.‚Äù

\*\*

From TradeSmithDaily:

The way the hedge funds could have done this ‚Äî made it appear as if they covered their shorts, even when they really didn‚Äôt ‚Äî involves trickery in the options market.

The tactics involved are not a secret. In fact, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) knows all about such tactics, and published a ‚Äúrisk alert‚Äù memo on the topic in August 2013.

The SEC memo is titled ‚ÄúStrengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations.‚Äù You can¬†[read it here via the SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

The memo contains a dozen pages of highly technical language, but here‚Äôs a quick rundown:

* If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades.
* A hedge fund that is short a stock can write call options on a stock ‚Äî meaning they are now ‚Äúshort‚Äù the call options, having sold the call options to someone else (typically a market maker) ‚Äî and simultaneously buy shares against the call options.
* The shares bought against the call options could be ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù longs ‚Äî meaning they are not part of the original share float of the stock ‚Äî as sold to the hedge fund by the market maker that takes the other side of the options trade.
* This works because, if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of ‚Äúnaked shorting‚Äù as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.
* As a result of the above transaction, the hedge fund that sold short calls was able to buy synthetic long shares against the calls. (A synthetic share is one that has a long on one side and a short on the other but wasn‚Äôt part of the original float.) The synthetic long shares are the other side of the naked shorts, legally initiated by the market maker, so the market maker can hedge.
* The hedge fund that bought the shares can now report that they have ‚Äúbought back‚Äù their short position via buying long shares ‚Äî except they actually haven‚Äôt! The synthetic shares they bought are canceled out against the short call positions they initiated, a necessity of the maneuver by way of the market maker‚Äôs hedging of the call position they bought from the hedge fund.

It gets very complicated, very fast. But the gist is that **hedge funds can use tricks to make it look like they‚Äôve covered their shorts ‚Äî even if they haven‚Äôt truly covered, and can‚Äôt, for lack of available float ‚Äî by way of exploiting loopholes** that exist due to an interplay of reporting rule delays, market maker naked shorting exceptions, and legal practices of synthetic share creation (new longs and shorts made from thin air) relating to market-making.

Below is a section of the SEC memo (from page 8) that gets to the heart of it:

***‚ÄúTrader A may enter a buy-write transaction, consisting of selling deep-in-the-money calls and buying shares of stock against the call sale. By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.*****‚Äù**

\*\*

In short (no pun intended) these tricks¬†‚Äúhelp hedge funds maintain short positions that, legally speaking, they weren‚Äôt supposed to have because the shares were never properly located‚Äù. Which triggers alarm bells when we consider the extraordinarily high amount of FTIDs/Failed to Deliver Shares ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)) and Michael Burry‚Äôs (now deleted tweet viewable here [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en)) about how when he called back shares he lent out, brokers took weeks to actually find them with the implication they could not be located.

These factors lend credence to the idea that shorts weren‚Äôt really covered but were given the impression of being covered with trickery using options, in order to ‚Äúcover‚Äù short positions they shouldn‚Äôt have had to begin with because shares were never properly located.

If this is true, and as explained earlier there are signs that indicate it is, this would allow short side funds to prolong their short positions indefinitely. This inspires a thought experiment, **if funds are able to prolong their short positions with this method, wouldn't it make more financial sense for them to prolong their shorts rather than truly cover and close out their shorts at a -500% to -5000% loss** when prices were at 300-400 last week (when they supposedly closed out a majority/large amount of short positions)? The saying for stocks goes
""its only a loss when you sell."" The version for shorts would be ""its only a loss if you close out your short positions.""

Another factor to consider is there are well reasoned arguments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/) and [here](https://pastebin.com/AuhuKJu4) (now a pastebin, originally a popular post from a reddit user) that, mathematically speaking, shorts could not have afforded to truly cover the majority of their positions. Based on this train of logic, if shorts could not have afforded to truly cover most of their positions, it may have made the most sense for shorts to only cover their most underwater positions and prolong the majority of remainder shorts positions with the help of synthetic longs. The end goal being to wait for retail interest and stock price to go back down before truly closing all their positions (though FTID/phantom shares caused by the synthetic longs may be another complication for shorts to close their positions.)

In addition, one point that may be relevant to explore is if a large amount of short positions were indeed truly covered, there would theoretically be immensely strong buy pressure to drive the price of the stock up. Instead, during the time that shorts supposedly covered, price of the stock somehow went into a free fall in the past week. Why? Something to think about.

I would be remiss to mention that another data point that may be of significance is that an entity recently purchased 43 million dollars worth of calls at 
800 dollars to expire in March. In practical terms what this purchase may seem to indicate is that whoever made the purchase believes there's a chance and risk the price of the stock could shoot past 800 by March, which would also suggest that they believe a squeeze is still possible and are hedging for it. If you happen to believe this entity is a hedge fund then you may draw your own inferences from that as to what that could mean.

In considering the potential use of synthetic longs by shorts to prolong their positions we must factor in the possibility that shorts might no longer be under as much pressure as they were before to cover. What can retail investors do in that case?

**A) One recourse retail investors could have would be to encourage GME to issue a reverse stock split as it forces borrowers to return shares back to their holders, which in theory would put the naked short sellers in a compromised position. If you care about forcing the issue, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcpwh0/how\_gme\_can\_still\_be\_a\_great\_play/gm2tsnw/)**

**B) Another recourse would be to bring the matter to the SEC's attention for investigation, which you can do at [https://www.sec.gov/tcr](https://www.sec.gov/tcr)**

Sidenote: On the subject of synthetic long shares, another instance where they came into the story recently was when S3 Partners released it's GME short interest % calculations last week, from a short interest from on 122% on 1/28 Thursday to 113% on 1/29 Friday) to 55% on 1/31 Sunday, which many found to be suspicious. Later it was discovered that number of 55% was calculated using the same data set that yielded 113% short interest percentage, but with the significant difference of including synthetic long shares into the short float equation, which is against standard practice but which S3 abruptly decided on Sunday to make their new main metric of SI%. Many questioned logic and timing of this decision. One consequence of this decision was that the media picked up on the ""new"" short interest percentage of 55% and spread it as a new narrative during market open on the morning of 2/1 Monday. Whether this influenced subsequent buy/sell behavior, and if so to what degree, is something to consider.

If you think about GME as a battle between short side funds and retail investors (there are likely other players involved but for the purpose of this analysis we'll focus on these two), information plays a major role and there is an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side. For example, hedge funds know the positions they're in and can share data with each other whereas retail investors are in the dark about many important data points. An example of an information asymmetry on the retail investor's side is the unavailability and general inaccessibility of true real-time short interest percentage. A lot of retail investors are waiting for the short interest report on February 9th to help inform them of their next moves, but while this report is a data point, the data in the report will still be two weeks old. With that said, examples of what investors have available for estimating the immediate short term interest are things like short interest borrow rate and calculated inferences from other data points.

There's an adage oft repeated on WSB that retail investors can be ""retarded"" longer than funds can stay solvent. The ""paper hand"" sell off earlier this week in part appears to contradict that statement. To explore it from another perspective, if you consider the possibility that short side funds are taking a long term play (on their short positions by extending them with synthetic long shares), then so far it would seem that funds can stay solvent longer than paper hands can stay patient (case in point being the retail sell-off when the price started dropping.) 

At least one lesson that could be draw from this is that the better retail investors understand how hedge funds think and operate, the better it will benefit them in navigating this situation intelligently. An analysis of events of the the past week leads me to believe hedge funds deployed at least three tactics from the Art of War:

* **""Deceiving and confusing the enemy is a more effective path to victory than openly fighting with them.""** I personally believe the press release from Melvin Capital on 1/27 about closing their short positions was an example of this, they wanted us to believe their short positions were closed thus ending justification for the short squeeze.
* **""If you know your enemies and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles.""** Hedge funds knew the weakness of the retail side was the lack of cohesion and leadership (by nature the lack of leadership was a disadvantage for any leader to the movement may be accused of manipulating retail buyers and scapegoated) and they knew that if price drops low enough many retail buyers will panic sell, so all they needed to do was attempt to drive the price down via whatever methods at their disposal whether thats through misinformation or Short Ladder Attacks which are and potentially other methods (there's arguments on whether Short Ladder Attacks really exist and I won't get into it here but I encourage you to do your own research)
* **""If his forces are united, separate them""** aka divide and conquer. Upon driving ""weak-hands"" to sell-off this divides the retail buying group and creates bears out of some of those who held, who then spread their views and further the divide. Another example is the silver fake news/manipulation and the very real possibility or reality of bots sent into this sub to push a message and sow division.

I will leave you with that and a reminder to do your own research, for as investors we do not have all the information, and the most we can do is intelligently speculate with as much data and logic as we can gather. I wrote this post because I spotted some inconsistencies within the GME stock that in my opinion, once brought to awareness, would either be irresponsible or willfully ignorant to not examine further. If you agree with the ideas explored in this post, feel free to share with whomever you'd like, and thank you for your part in raising awareness.

And I can't transfer to fidelity any sooner. 


My plan was to kill my rh account in a few weeks/months when this is over. Because it's too much hastle and not enough time to transfer right now. 


But now I'm stick with shares of gme and amc THAT I DON'T EVEN FUCKING OWN 


I'm fucking pissed. And I just want to be sure I own my stocks.

For those who say there is no ‚Äúmovement‚Äù or ‚Äú revolution‚Äù behind GME. Hear me out because it‚Äôs the individual options traders (WSB retards) who will end up suffering the most.,"‚ÄúThe stock market as a whole has become a derivative of the options market.‚Äù    -some guy

My tiny brain heard from some kid in my special ed class that the people who shorted got enough ‚Äúcash infusions‚Äù to cover their interest on shorts for a lot longer.  We thought ‚Äúthe war was going to be over by Christmas‚Äù, but they were given a lot more ammo and are dug in harder now.  They probably  re-shorted at the high points and are waiting to cash out.( we will know more tomorrow night) They want the real holders to give up on this.   They want to out last us until we need the rent money we invested when we thought we were going to get a fast gain. By re-shorting it shows what kind of blood thirsty maniacs these people are. They don‚Äôt just want out.  Now that we have fucked with them, they want to teach us a lesson. The initial run up was probably just a retail euphoria run.  They used that to re-short harder.   

The overall fight here isn‚Äôt going to be determined by the little guys, there are big funds/whales on our side who are out for the shorters too.  We have sharpened sticks, while the big players are in a nuclear stand-off. 

We have to take this into a historic fact.   If we (retail and big guys who are with us) hold out and the shorts have to cover, this event would set a precedent.  Not only do the shorts want to put us in our places tilling their fields. If they loose, we prove we are capable of playing in the big leagues and don‚Äôt need anyone to hold our hands(which they charge us to do) If we win we maintain our ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù as individual traders.  Anyone who says this is just about money, there is no ‚Äúmovement‚Äù or ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù here, apparently doesn‚Äôt realize if we fuck this up, they will most likely fuck with the rights of individual traders to play in the options game(where a lot of the WSB tards make good money.). The sentiment is, that these crazy ‚Äúoptions yolos‚Äù throw a huge burden on the overall stability of the market, by causing the options writers to buy shares to cover any exercised options. They have to buy a factor of between 2x and up to 10x+ to make sure the supply is there and hedge against potential failure to delivers. This drives up the price of shares by a similar factor.  The more people that get onboard the more it drives up the price due the them hedging up. Kinda the opposite of what the shorts do. It‚Äôs a chain reaction.  This could have been why Robinhood halted on specific stocks, to prevent failure to delivers. As individuals we can do crazy shit like put all of grandmas inheritance into a crazy call and then let the other bandwagon tards follow us and do the same. The funds have fiduciary responsibilities to not yolo their clients into crazy risk like this.  It‚Äôs either illegal or really stupid for them. Us retail dummies are a risk to their ability to understand/predict the market.  It‚Äôs like when you get more than one ball on a pinball machine.  

Really, I think all we as individuals can do in the GME case is be stubborn more than ever and hold until they give up, and buy more if you can. This could last a long time though. Just do this to be an asshole if that‚Äôs what gets you going. 

Hold on and prepare for a war of attrition.  But never take your eyes off of this.  We are at the whims of the big guys on our side.  If they give up we are going down with them.   

To those big guys who are here with us.  Thank you.

The narrative of WSB has changed but there weren‚Äôt any factors that could‚Äôve changed it. Let‚Äôs think about this new narrative that someone is pushing.,"The factors for the GME play are still stay the same. All of that DD you read in the first place that got you to buy into GME are still relevant. 

Obviously like many others here have stated, WSB has unfortunately been taken over by bots and people who are most likely be getting paid to ruin the sub and change the narrative. 

Positive posts are being taken down and suddenly negative GME is the new meta. 

Maybe more of us would‚Äôve fallen for it if it wasn‚Äôt such an immediate switch. 

On Friday, I spent an unhealthy amount of time on WSB and I can tell you the positivity was there and üíéüôås, ‚ÄúGME to the moon‚Äù, üöÄüöÄüöÄ morale was still very strong as it had been for almost 2 weeks straight. 

Suddenly I wake up Saturday morning and it was like someone flipped a switch. All negativity and a lot of people claiming to be ‚ÄúOG‚Äù WSB yet they‚Äôre harassing GME holders. 

I‚Äôve been apart of WSB since 800k degenerates and no where along the journey has there ever been this kind of hostility towards 1 particular stock and play. 

After checking the comment history on a lot of these infiltrators and even though they may have been apart of Reddit for 3+ years, many of them haven‚Äôt commented in months or years and then suddenly they are now posting 9-10 negative comments per hour FOR 12+ HOURS STRAIGHT. 

Dead. Giveaway. 

This is my speculation, but I really think they‚Äôre real people being paid to ruin WSB. 

Plus top mods being removed and replaced by new unknown people. It‚Äôs a wreck. 

So why do I mention this? 

Well I know many of you would see the price tanking on GME and rely on WSB to lift your spirits, but WSB may not be able to lift your spirits anymore. This is the time where if you‚Äôre really diamond hands you have to stay confident in your position and it‚Äôs a little harder to find confirmation bias. (Although I like this r/GME sub. Lots of smart people here it seems. Come here then) 

Remember that nothing has changed except the price. 

These hedge funds want to scare you. Don‚Äôt let them scare you. They‚Äôre still playing dirty which shows that GME is not over. If it was over none of this would be happening. 



Now, what does the strong WSB infiltration tell us? 

The biggest red flag I see if that it didn‚Äôt happen on Friday, it happened around midnight - 2am on Saturday. Everything was still normal Friday night, but by early Saturday morning it was dominated by negativity. 


So here‚Äôs some questions I came up with that we should ask ourselves and think about the possibilities. 


1. Were they waiting to see what GME‚Äôs price would do Friday? 
Meaning if it went down would they have bothered with this effort? 

2. Are they planning a huge short attack on Monday to try and legitimize this new narrative? 

3. Are they afraid of the short interest being released on Tuesday? 
Meaning if it‚Äôs not manipulated and actually shows a surge in short interest will it be so devastating for them that they need to convince as many as possible to sell on Monday before the data comes out? Making this weekend effort to ruin WSB some kind of Hail Mary? 

4. Why didn‚Äôt this happen last weekend after GME was mooning all week? There was a huge drop this week, shouldn‚Äôt that have been good for them? Why this now?

5. Since it is so obvious that there‚Äôs an agenda to get WSBers to sell, why would you get pushed around and sell from that fear? 

6. Why? Why is there this sudden hostile takeover of WSB whose bashing GME and GME holders trying to create fear and cause a sell off? Someone has a lot to lose?

7. If all of the shorts actually covered why would there be so much obvious manipulation? 

8. Why do they want you to sell so badly that they‚Äôd go to this level?

9. Why hasn‚Äôt there been DD or any reasons stated as to why you should sell? I haven‚Äôt seen any data or any reasoning as to why it‚Äôs over. 



None of this is financial advice nor am I a financial advisor. 

Be ready for a big week. This squeeze could take many weeks to happen. Be ready for the worst this week but let‚Äôs hope it‚Äôs going up. Either way I will be diamond hands even if it‚Äôs another huge drop. 

Let me know what you think about the strong WSB infiltration. 

TLDR: Just because WSB is breaking down doesn‚Äôt mean people are selling. You aren‚Äôt alone there‚Äôs many diamond hands out there. Someone is showing their cards by going to these extreme efforts to get us to sell. They have a lot to lose it seems. üíéüôå",GME,1612746237,lbuck12,7,1,True,2021-02-07

ALLEGATION:  SECURITIES FRAUD, NAKED SHORTING COLLUSION BETWEEN MELVIN AND CITADEL

&amp;#x200B;

Let's roleplay, retards.  I'll play the billionaire fuckhead who wants to bankrupt Gamestop, because I think it'll be a fun story to jerk off to.

&amp;#x200B;

I hatch a brilliant little plan to short them to death.  Here's my plan.

&amp;#x200B;

I collude with the company who invested in me, who processes my transactions, to make the world think I have 5 Million GME.   This happens.  I don't know how, but keep going with me.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, all I have to do, is NEVER let one of these specific 5 million GME shares out of my account, or the jig is up.  They'd be caught as a FAIL TO DELIVER if someone ever got their hands on one.  So how do I never sell one of these?  Shorting!

&amp;#x200B;

But no no guys... not just regular shorting.    We... we would short.  EVERY.  TRANSACTION.      EVEN THE ONES THAT LOSE US MONEY.  It's more important and valuable to me to pay for a clean share off the market to boomerang back, than it is to release one of my POISON SHARES into the market and get found out.  Luckily, I know a clearinghouse that sits in front of all my transactions, and can help with this little bit of intercepting magic.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we do this for a while.   Hey, wait, a big order came in, there wasn't enough float in the pool to boomerang clean shares, oh shit, we let a couple go.   Well, let's wait and see what happens.

&amp;#x200B;

&lt; INSERT LINK HERE TO THE FAIL-TO-DELIVERS ON GME SECURITY OVER TIME &gt;  [https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png](https://i.redd.it/1wpfodbyb6f61.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, shit.  Things are warming up.   People think Gamestop might really come back.   If there's a lot of trading, they might've found out about my 5 million FAKE POISON shares, when the clearinghouse comes to deduct it from my account.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, shit.   It happened.  A lot.   Look at those fail to delivers.   They're everywhere on $GME, and only on GME.

&amp;#x200B;

The jig is up.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to get caught, so I hit my ""omfg algorithm"" button, that will liquidate and put any asset in my entire portfolio in front of those buy orders for GME.  I know, the redditors are idiots, so I'll HEDGE THIS POSITION with another profitable meme position.... like AMC.

They decided ""FUCK IT"" eventually, and traded in their **FAKE SHARES** for **REAL MONEY** at some point during this, and those are **FOUND OUT WITH FAIL TO DELIVERS**.   THEY ARE SLIDING ALL THEIR ILL GOTTEN GME GAINS INTO OTHER STOCKS, PROBABLY THRU OTHER BROKERS, **SO THEY CAN BERNIE MADOFF THIS BITCH AND RUN AWAY WITH ALL THE MONEY.**

&amp;#x200B;

THOSE ARE FAKE SHARES, ""CREATED"" BY CITADEL AS IF MELVIN OWNED THEM, AND ALWAYS FRONTED (SEE: LAUNDERED) CLEAN SHARES WHENEVER TRANSACTIONS WOULD HAVE COME IN FOR THEM.   AND THERES WAY MORE THAN 5 MILLION **AND** **~~ITS NOT JUST~~** **MIGHT NOT JUST BE GAMESTOP.  \[Edited, im retarded\]**

They are now actively ponzi scheming.  You can again, see it in the trends.  Its hydraulic flow of capital, across securities, to protect their one, poisoned, fake stance.   This is MASSIVELY ILLEGAL to cover with borrowed.  **I didnt know what the fuck a ponzi scheme even WAS until I started trying to find a way to explain my stupid fucking waterfall analogy.**

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know why % held by institutions was above 100% for way too fucking explainably long?   Those were the fake shares that citadel and melvin colluded to make.  Melvin as a short seller, wouldnt look suspicious if the ""institutional % held"" by them was high.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know why % of float went down, that wierd S3 data anomaly?  They started selling.  Their.  **Fake**.   Shares.   

&amp;#x200B;

Do you know why we see lots of fail to delivers occurring?   Those are those fake shares showing up in the drains.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a ponzi scheme all along.  Just, it was being held WITHIN the single GME security.   **But, on thursday, they got caught.**  The financial world was either sleeping on it, or in on it, and wasnt prepared for them to get caught.  **Either way really doesn't matter right now, as the result was:  RAISE THE MARGINS.  LET THEM DIE.  ......** oh also we mightve just fucked a bunch of smaller brokers.... like, a lot of them, by essentially making them have to have 10x more operating capital than they do.....  well....  whatever, everyone sees the writing on the wall.  If they believe, they'll raise some more capital.  Please correlate this with the actual facts surrounding robinhood, 212, etc halt of trading.  They DID fuck up too with their reaction, I am not excusing them.   **But look at the actual events.**

&amp;#x200B;

So they were caught.  Nothing to do now, but to sell their fake shares.  They've been doubling down on shorts this whole time since probably $20, all the while leaking faked shares into the pool. We all hold fake shares.  There's no way of knowing anymore.  The well is poisoned.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to force a shareholder vote now, to get a tally.   **We need to force the SEC to do their goddamn jobs and fast, go freeze these criminals assets COMPLETELY, NOT THE GME SECURITY ALONE,** because they are GETTING AWAY WITH IT via a naked ponzi scheme.

&amp;#x200B;

**The bomb is no longer contained within GME**.  They detonated their bomb on thursday, when they got CAUGHT, and decided that its jail no matter what, so they clicked the algorithm named ""PONZI SCHEME"" and fucking started making calls to drum up disinfo.  **Do you understand the criminal motive, of a 100% defeated foe (fake shares revealed), to do another criminal self preserving move (ponzi)?**  

&amp;#x200B;

Up until Thursday they were using legal mechanisms to push back from being found out.  When they got caught, they switched to illegal ponzi mechanisms.  I'm a fucking ape and I can understand this criminal motive.

When the ponzi algorithm runs out, you are left with a stock GME that has a market cap representing $0 of melvins dollars, and a market cap of whatever other securities they are funneling their money into, representing $all of melvins dollars.   **Do you notice how, if melvin also held some sort of position in those other companies, melvin still has his dollars?**  And do you notice how there are exactly $0 of melvins money to squeeze out of GME when the correction actually occurs?  P O N Z I

THEY WILL WIN, unless the **REGULATORS COME AND DO THEIR GODDAMN JOB.**  And remember, **the villians here have already released the poison into the well.**  It's gonna be very very very VERY hard to unpoison this shit.  **Do the regulators just say that, hey, that amount of lead in your drinking water is fine now?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Let's see whose side they are really on.**   

&amp;#x200B;

I've forwarded it to a diverse range of tiplines and media outlets.  I am not enough.  One retards voice will never be heard.  Apes strong together.   APES STRONG TOGETHER.

&amp;#x200B;

Only the light of day will reveal all these SQUIRMING, MISINFORMING, MONSTERS hiding in our system.   The data is there.  Only those who DO NOT WANT TO SEE IT, are not seeing it.  **They are the paper handed bitches**, who are barking as loud as they can BECAUSE THEIR JAW IS MADE OF STYROFOAM AND FAKE SHARES.

&amp;#x200B;

You and I are all /u/2am_spaghetti, because /u/2am_spaghetti is just some **fucking nerd** who knows how to game systems (IN VIDEO GAMES) and can see some fucking patterns in this system.  These monsters are game theorying real life, **and they just lost**.  But rather than pay the cost, they are literally trying to hit reset by doing a manuever that has historically nuked the entire system, counting that the lay person doesn't know enough.  Because it worked in '08.  And who knows how many other times.

Make your own judgement, apes.

=======================

Original post below.

&amp;#x200B;

please help me, I'm resorting to just sending people reddit DMs, I am 110% certain of this, you can call me the time traveler

Their stoploss algorithm is modeled after HYDRAULICS across their whole portfolio.  The squeeze has a pressure relief valve, and this is it.

[https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe](https://imgur.com/MHmpwVe)  Edit:  maybe a better explanation? ::  [https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc](https://imgur.com/gallery/5t9QgEc)

Imagine using your car jack while the handle is twisted open.  No pressure, fluid is just movin around.  Even in this state, sometimes if you pump it fast enough you can see little jumps of life.  The real solution though, is to Tighten it up, now we have a pressurized system.

Visualize their algorithm as a cascading waterfall, pouring portfolio-wide capital to the very bottom until there is literally nothing left and in which case it EXPLODES.    We hit that thursday with those reports of 5k bids being filled right before everything shut down.  But in this waterfall, the only stock they HAVE to defend is GME. They already are out of water, but theyve erected an insanely big waterfall that hides where they are out of water up top, and fills it in by the time its time to fulfill at the bottom buy. The hole has ALWAYS been there the moment they overshorted, and it remains.  Its why they didnt bail at 20, or 80, or 115.  THEY CAN'T AS LONG AS THOSE NAKED SHORT VOLUME &gt; FLOAT.   This was the math all along.

This also explains the Fail to delivers on GME, the clearinghouses are finding the fake shares in the drains while Melvin tries to chlorine this pool.

**TLDR:** The mathematical strategy of the situation is to **reduce the blue area's leverage (multiplicative)**, and **grow the maximum red force (additive).**

&amp;#x200B;

We have to reduce blue to win, or come up with an incredible amount of red, quickly.  If we don't, all of yellows dollars will flow to the other meme stocks / negatively correlated stocks and THERE WILL BE LESS TENDIES == LESS TOP END OF SQUEEZE.  IN FACT, GME TENDIES ARE BASICALLY BEING GIVEN TO THE OTHER STOCKS, IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE COSTS LOW, SO THE COST OF COVERING THOSE FAIL TO DELIVERS IS MANAGEABLE.

Melvin (or to be fair, whoever originally authored and held the naked short shares) is using TIME as their ally - **THE FAIL TO DELIVERS == THE AMOUNT OF NAKED SHORT STOCK**, and IF THEY RUN OUT THE CLOCK, ALL OF THEIR FAKE STOCK GETS CAUGHT IN THE DRAINS AND IS PAID FOR BY WHOEVER PAYS FOR THAT SHIT **AND THEY DO NOT GO TO JAIL**

This theory connects the dots.

**Please if you have an in with wsb mods etc, forward them this to read.  Ive been trying via modmail, posts, everything.   Anyone with a platform needs to know this.   Since all the memes are booming like an ETF, the profits on the others are being just siphoned into GME which holds their ultimate loss - the naked shorts that we KNOW they have on GME.**

EDIT2:  omg melvin is so sinister.  They knew redditors would bandwagon.  They are using our own UNFOCUSED HYPE against us to prop up GME.  PLEASE HELP ME BE A MEGAPHONE, WE HAVE TO GET THE WORD OUT.

SELLING GME PUTS VS BUYING SHARES OUTRIGHT,"Hey Apes did you know that **paper hands will pay you money to buy their GME from them at a lower than it currently trades for?** I thought not.

Selling puts has a lot of advantages over buying shares outright.

1. If you like GME at $100 per share, then you should love it at $75 yes? When you sell a put with a 75$ strike price you are agreeing to potentially buy 100 shares at $75 per share at a future date if GME is below $75 at that date.
2. Some idiot with paper hands **WILL PAY YOU** a premium for the right to sell you shares at a price lower than it currently is.
3. **If your put gets exercised (if GME is below 75 or whatever strike you choose by a future date)**, then shares pass from paper hands to diamond hands and (correct me if I'm wrong on this part) the transaction won't add to any after hours massive red candle stick that sows FUD.
4. The premium you get paid should be enough for you to buy up more GME shares as well.

The downside is that you have to put up the cash as collateral and may have to buy in blocks of 100 shares at a time. For example, if you sell 1 put contract at a $75 strike price you need to have $7500 as collateral.

**TL;DR: Buying shares uses fuel for the GME rocket and selling puts is setting up refueling stations for said rocket.**

This is not financial advice. I'm still holding my 2 GME shares. Please upvote and share if you want more people to know about this option.

How have a huge percentage of short positions been closed without driving up the price?,"Why have 70 percent of short positions supposedly exited without a squeeze?

So I‚Äôve read that S3 shortsighted and Ortex a reporting that there around 55% short positions still active.

That‚Äôs decrease of about %70 from last weeks numbers.

How could they have done this without buying back their borrowed shares and driving up the price? I can only assume that they exited pre-market when the price rose to $550 and somehow made an agreement for the long whales to not buy into it, or sell their shares.

I hate to sound conspiracy, but the only way I can see this happening is if the borrowed shares never existed in the first place and they‚Äôve essentially been let off the hook.

Is there anywhere other than WSB to discuss what‚Äôs happening with this stock? I see a lot of HOLD, but not very much analysis or explanation of how there‚Äôs only 50% short positions left..",GME,1612208945,Robipadpoop,16,5,True,2021-02-01

‚ÄùThe volume is low‚Äù.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It‚Äôs illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you‚Äôd need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They‚Äôve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement.

THIS IS WHY üëèüíéüíé Upvote so everyone knowsüëè,"I get it now. I completely understand why nobody is selling for the money.

I got into $GME very late. I had a couple shares back at $20, had paper hands, and sold. I went all in a couple of days ago. Despite it only being a couple of days, I've been lurking here for a bit. The amount of 6 figure, 7 figure, and 8 figure gains I was seeing was blowing my mind. More than that, it was blowing my mind that nobody was selling. I thought, ""you made a 7 figure profit, what more do you want?"" Now that I'm all in, I've been staying more up to date with the things that are happening. And now I get it.

"All these brokerages claim they restricted buying because all funds had to be settled and their clearinghouse was at their limit. If that was the case, why not halt the entire market to keep everyone on even ground until all funds settle?","Vlad talked about the reason for the restrictions at [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-ceo-refutes-game-stop-hedge-fund-conspiracy-theory-and-reveals-what-actually-happened-234600703.html). His excuse is that other brokerages did the same thing too because their clearinghouses were at their limit. If that was the case, why not halt the entire market for everyone until all funds clear so hedge funds wouldn't short ladder attack? 

&amp;#x200B;

They have clearly acknowledged that the stock is extremely volatile and I am sure they have enough brain cells to realize what would happen when you restrict buying for an extremely volatile stock. Knowing the obvious, they still went through with their decision. I just can't buy the whole ""clearinghouses were at limit"" argument since they didn't halt the entire market to actually protect investors as they claim to have done; if anything, they've damaged their investors.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that they will continue the restrictions onto next week to allow enough shorts to possibly cover their positions slowly. If not that, they will keep the price between some range to essentially kill the volatility, which would result in a significant drop in premiums for options. They want to force us to take profits and leave by doing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I doubt the SEC will do anything until much of the volatility has died down. They'll continue to say they're ""investigating it."" Once the volatility has died down, they will jump in and slap these hedge funds on the wrist pretending like they're always on our side. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, if they do manage to kill volatility and premiums, all people would have to do is continue to diamond hand and possibly keep buying options to keep premiums high. They will try to demoralize shareholders. Remember, the stock market is mostly about psychological warfare rather than the actual fundamentals they claim. 

&amp;#x200B;

FFS their fundamentals always keep changing. If the small investors win this fight, they will simply readjust their ""fundamentals"" and claim that it is due to times changing (which wouldn't be wrong). But until they lose this fight, they will keep claiming that this market goes against their fundamentals. Remember, what happened with Tesla? Every one of these Wall Street schmucks kept talking about how overpriced Tesla was, only for them to come out and increase their price targets just last year because of ""fundamentals"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So, don't worry if the short squeeze doesn't happen this week. They know, people are hyped about next week and the best way to kill that hype is to make sure nothing happens.",GME,1612035597,KrazyKryptardn-t,0,1,True,2021-01-30

$GME **REVERSE** SHORT LADDER ATTACK on Monday??," 

Am I talking crazy, or is this possible?? Let's fight back!

Here's my thought.. If you are already looking to jump in for more $GME on Monday, execute your best buy price possible .. but then,

BUY JUST 1 MORE SHARE at like 10-15% ABOVE THE ASK PRICE.

If all 7M WSB people here just bought ONE (or more?) $GSM at 110% of the ask at the open on Monday, what do you think would happen? Especially with dollar-cost averaging of your earlier limit or market buy, you're ""overpaying"" what.. maybe $40-50? .. to help trigger a buying frenzy that could send the price past the moon by lunchtime?? That'd catch some attention, draw in more buyers, more price increase, rinse, repeat...

I've been here on WSB awhile, but mostly lurk. But, you crazy YOLO'ers hooked me this time.

This thought popped into my head, watching Cramer telling us we've already won.. take the home run and SELL $GME. Don't go for the grand slam, basically. This SELL hype will probably be pitched all weekend.. and the short ladder attacks are probably underway already. I have no idea what'll happen on Monday, but it'll be interesting.

Let's say GME teamed up with AMC to put video game arenas in AMC theaters.,"During the day they could give promotions to kids to come to the arcade under a program of re-socializing kids to undo the psychological damage of the lockdowns (an essential upcoming social cause). At night they could function like video game bars which have been very successful here in Chicago (a currently proven business model i.e. Emporium). AMC already has very nice movie theaters across the country, and GME already has tons of video game equipment. I personally would definitely patronize this venture repeatedly when things open up, and I think many across the country would do the same (and across the world if people could play with/against people in other countries while at these arcades).

Passive investors are playing a big part in helping to fuel GameStop's rally and prevent declines in the stock

BlackRock, the world's largest provider of exchange traded funds, was one of the big winners from GameStop's surging share price 

By William Canny

Friday January 29, 2021 2:53 pm

The focus is on the Reddit army of small investors, but the explosion in passive investing has also played a big part in the GameStop market frenzy.

It's not just retail fueling the massive gains. Take industry giants such as BlackRock and Vanguard, who feature prominently among GameStop's top holders. Those firms have to hold shares of the company for their ETF products. As the shares gain, ETFs and other passive funds need to buy more stocks ‚Äî these funds aren't able to sell the shares and take profits unlike stock pickers.",GME,1612038302,Immediate_Night8088,2,1,True,2021-01-30

Hedge Funds are Screwed and Price Target Prior to Government Intervention,"**Wall street and hedge funds are utterly screwed.**

I've been a redditor for almost 10 years, rarely submitting posts or commenting, just mainly a lurker to read comments.

I stumbled upon some due diligence posts about GME over the past weekend on WallStreetBets, and decided to jump in on Monday at a price at $95. I still haven't sold, but with a stock price at $325, I could have easily tripled my money throughout the week and got out.

I mainly have followed the conservative investing subreddits, such as [r/financialindependence](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/), [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/), which have suggested to invest in total stock market index funds, reduce fees, and enjoy my 7% return after inflation. After 6 years of this, things have been going ok, good, but not nutbusting exciting. I returned almost just as much from GME in this past week than from my entire 6 week working career. Granted, I know my GME earnings are fictitious, since I haven't sold yet and it can come crashing down (being a bagholder) at any point.

This whole week, I thought to myself, what sell target should I set? Since I consider myself a fairly conservative person, I would have been happy with doubling, or tripling my money and to not take part in this fiasco. After learning about infinity squeezes, I set my price target at $999.

After this past week transpired, I think here are some events that transpired that I think were the nails in the coffin for the hedge funds in wall street.

1. Viral spread of social media. EVERYONE is talking about GME. Everyone is going into WallStreetBets and taking a look. My boomer dad mentioned it to me last week, even before I heard about what was going on! Hedge funds have underestimated the power of virility of information through the internet and its exponential speed of growth. EVERYONE is buying stocks, all over the globe, from an already short supply of available stocks in the float.

2. Tweets from billionaires. Chamath Palihapitiya and Elon Musk, some of the most famous billionaries in the world!!!! Tweeted about GME. This is something that Wall street could have NEVER forecasted. This was the nail in the coffin for them, they never saw this type of exposure coming. Millions of people follow these billionaires, they are jumping in on the fun, and we have influential billionaires on our side.

3. Other hedge fund sharks coming in. Now that there is blood in the water, other hedge funds are joining in the party. They know what short squeezes are, they know how to put other funds in vulnerable positions and to play the odds. Not only do we have the power of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and the people of the ENTIRE world, but we also have the power of other whales. The enemy of our enemies are really going to be the ones to push us past the finish line.

I thought to myself, Melvin capital and these hedge funds guys, they're smart. They'll figure out a way to weasel out of this situation and STILL make money some how. But with the 3 big factors above, these are things that they could have never seen coming, which makes me think they are utterly f\*cked.

Now for exit strategy price target. I currently have a $1,000 price target that would trigger, allowing me to break even, and then another sell limit order at $1,500, that would 15x my money. Bear in mind, I consider myself a conservative average joe, and want to get in and out QUICKLY. So here is another data point for you guys, for what a fairly conservative person is setting his price target at.

I know everyone on WallStreetBets has crazy meme price targets of $69,420 etc., but this would just crash the entire economy. So I thought to myself, what would the max price target be without initiating government intervention? If the government gets involved, this could ruin the party for everybody. Can someone help me do the calculation, with a price target that would bankrupt only the hedge funds and market makers involved, and not the underlying banks that would initiate government intervation?

GME halted last week... Why brokerages are openly lying to youüëêüíéüëê," 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img i6nkf9ddaje61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements.

**First we examine the brokerages finances**

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day.

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

**Next lets examine GME volume**

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share,

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share,

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with.

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. üëêüíéüëê

Worse... you have betrayed millions of people who trusted you to Democratize the stonk market.

You have a chance to redeem yourself by doing the right thing

1. Immediately  Allow people to freely trade GME, AMC, NOK and any other stock you may  have restricted.  Do this now before the inevitable margin calls destroy  the investment of many of your users.
2. Eliminate margin calls for the next one week on the stocks whose purchase you halted.

1  and 2 are both the right thing to do... and the thing that will limit  the very real financial damage to your users and others.  This in turn  will help reduce your exposure.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )
 
Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.
 
First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .
 
Official definition:
 
* Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted.
* Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question.
* A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.
 
Dumbed down version:
 
\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.
 
\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""
 
Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days
 
[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days
 
[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days
 
So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.
 
So what does that mean for us?
 
Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.
 
Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.
 
**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**
 
Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!
 
The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET. 
 
We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.
 
TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Feeling Cute: Might delete later,"Maybe you remember me, maybe you don‚Äôt. But I need y‚Äôall‚Äôs help. You know most of this but it‚Äôs a different take, a different goal, a different audience exposure. 

You can save people money, boost the economy, help companies hit record profit numbers and save jobs. 

Will need someone with good skills to explain this to normies (I‚Äôve suggested 2 subs, maybe you know more...but if you‚Äôve got wives, maybe they can spread it to their neighborhood circles.)




What if I told you that there‚Äôs a company that has memberships available that gives you $5 monthly certificates, which you can use in store to buy anything, including ALL gift cards (exception visa).

You can get $10 Amazon gift cards for $5 a month. 
If you and your partner have an account each, you can get 2x$10 gift cards for only $10 a month. 


You can do this for any gift card on the wall, with the exception of Visa (because that‚Äôs considered money laundering). 

So gaming gift cards? 
Yes

Amazon? Yes

Restaurants? Yes

Apple? Yes

Imagine how much money you can save. 

The ROI comes out to 400% in one year when you include the 1st complimentary $5 cert when you first join, the 12 monthly $5 certificates, the $5 birthday certificates, plus any additional certificate you redeem from 5000 point offer. 


#Do you have the following?

(Stoc.kTwi.ts could help too)

1. More wrinkles on your brain than your ball sack

2. A clean SFW Reddit account (not tied to these subs) with +3 years of experience and highly knowledgeable with karma.

3. Ability to articulate and demonstrate the benefits of said membership in a concise but easy to follow understandable format.

4. Math expertise to breakdown the ROI for others.

5. Willing to work outside of work hours.

Ok if you do, start working on a post that can be posted in places such as r.fru.gal or r.lif.protip.s and similar places. Those 2 have 20 mil subs combined....


Remember that what you are doing will be saving families money, boosting the economy, sales &amp; profits of many companies, saving jobs.

My fellow GME retards these are the only weapons shorters have," 

FIrst of all... ofcourse thiS is NOT financial advise you fucking boomer shart! This is my point of view of what I have noted and came across the internet with my smooth brain over the last couple days.

my dear retarded fellow GME autists!! As you for **SURE** already know with your 15.somwhat IQ the literally fucked shorters have no options left... they are soooo fucking fucked in their poopy makers, that they have resorted to and intensifying their controversial dirty tactieks!!

Obligatory rockets for goodluck: **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ** **üöÄ**

Their only weapons they are using now is creating Bearish BULLSHIT news and trying to speak thru all their channels (uhem uhem Cramer bitch is fake news).... Some even trying to make you believe that they are our friends and on our side (god fucking dammit i hate that sleezy fucker Cramer) or Bullish (spreadig disguised bearish news as they think we wont see)

THEY ARE SPREADING FUD to stop the momentum and the FOMO that has been build on friday. They may and try and flood the market, but we buy all the dips like its chocolate sunday and we smooth brains actually forgot its winter behind the wall!!

DONT forget that diamond hands üíéüñê probably get 72 virgins in heaven which you can share with your wifes boyfriend... I have Islamic roots so I actually am officially allowed to promis you this.

Don't fucking settle for 65$... I know I wont.... don't fucking be a retard and sell at 420.69... howeever you are a less degenerate retard if you sell at 694.20.

REMEMBER GUYS... THE fucking **BASE** VALUE **BEGINS** at 800$ and can go up to 2400 (see link 1 for big brain explanation) . So even if there is a dip on the way to the moon and your lambo's dont be a retard and sell... EVEN if the squeeze doesnt squoze (which is inevitable in my opinion) and everything is fucked just have pati√©nce until our lord and savior RC turn this Blockbuster into the goddamn E-commerce with a value of 50 billion dollar so you can sell at an organic price of 800. In mY OPINION THERE IS NO FUCKING LOSS into jumping into this fucking space-ship.

THIS IS not fucking done!! THIS IS HISTORY IN THE MAKING!!! FUCKING LIVE THIS MOMENT VIVIDLY AND ENJOY!! YOU AND I ARE MAKING HISTORY!! YOU WILL BE PLAYED IN A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE BY NONE OTHER THAN MICHAEL CERA AND OR GUZMAN ( I will be played by DiCaprio of course). WE ARE 2.1 MILLION strong and CANT SLEEP THRU THIS FOMO!

"IMPORTANT NEWS FOR GME GANG AND NEWCOMERS.... DON'T PANIC WHEN TRADING STOPS TEMPORARY ( LULD), READ ABOUT THIS IN THIS POST.","My fellow retard brethren of GME. Last friday we experience halts on GME trading purely because of a halt/stop of trading that was triggered by what is called a LULD ([click here to read all about LULD](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/MarketRegulation/LULD_FAQ.pdf)). 

LULD is basically an automatic mechanism which halts trading of a stock if it goes up by 10% in 5 minutes.... GME was soaring and flying to the moon so 10% is nothing but a bitch so it triggered a LULD.... a lot of paper handed bitches paniced and sold to shorters which killed the upward momentum. It is almost certain this will happen again the following days (We are flying duh!!)...

Why you shouldn‚Äôt be mad at people who sell,"As I stay up late tonight, reminiscing on the crazy fucking week I just experienced, listening to the tendie man on repeat, I recall seeing everywhere people being downvoted and shamed for selling GME shares after green Friday. I‚Äôve come to some conclusions.
I‚Äôll start by saying, if you did sell, 1) you‚Äôre kind of retarded, but then again we all are, you just are more. 2) you can still buy and make gains, just don‚Äôt let emotion influence your trades. Look at what happened today and decide if you could‚Äôve made more if you held, make this a learning experience 3) don‚Äôt brag about your pussy retard move by posting about selling a stock when it hurts investors who have invested savings and the company we want to see succeed so much. If you do it, you‚Äôre letting the devil win (AKA Andrew Left). 
My next point is that when people do sell GME, which is expected for any stock (stocks can some time go down before they go up people), it allows a cheaper price to buy in at and therefore even higher gains once the bigger and the biggest gains come. 
Also, what do you think will happen when GME hits 1000$? People will continue to hold? No. People believe in GME, I believe in GME, but there will be selloffs in the low hundreds, at that point we all buy back in and this shit either repeats or everyone moves on to NOK or BB. The main message here is don‚Äôt be a pussy and buy the dip faggot. 
My last point is, it‚Äôs their money. They earned it by stealing their moms credit card and buying stocks on Robinhood like all of us. If they want to sell, I‚Äôll be there to pick it up, and when they get FOMO, they‚Äôll buy in at a higher price from someone who did what they originally did. It‚Äôs a circle of life, but we have to live in harmony. Like I said, if you do sell GME, don‚Äôt post it in WSB, on twitter or on r/GME. You never know if your post could be the cascade. 
Today during the fall from $80 to $50 I was very nervous. I let my emotions get the best of me during the spike and bought more shares at 70$. I was really considering selling all, but now it looks like Monday, 70$ is gonna be what market will be at around 10 am. No one had said anything during the circuit breaker. I grew some diamond encrusted nuts and said here and WSB (which got me 1 day ban because the mods suck cock) in a post, ‚ÄúDO NOT SELL‚Äù. I refreshed and there were ten other people just like me. We are holding gentlemen. DDAY has just started, and Berlin is far from where we are. Give tendie man a listen if you‚Äôre ever down, don‚Äôt get emotional trading next week, and don‚Äôt forget to buy the dips and hold the line, lots of news will be posting negatively about GME, people will tell you to sell, all I have to say is nothing has changed, hold your ground, and may the tendies rain. 

TL; DR:
- It‚Äôs their money
- You buy the shares they sell at a lower price (buying the dip faggot)
- They‚Äôre the ones who miss out

- don‚Äôt get emotional trading 
- you shouldn‚Äôt sell
- communication with other traders during the day is important

"If you can‚Äôt afford 100 shares, buy deep ITM calls (LEAPS)","Evening everyone! I‚Äôm going to present to you an alternative to buying shares, which is much more capital friendly, effectively a leveraged position, and results in similar price movements.

The trick: deep in the money call, typically dated a bit farther out, aka the LEAPS. If you‚Äôre not familiar with those, I do encourage you to learn a bit about them on YouTube (Kamikaze Cash, for instance), especially if you don‚Äôt know anything about options in general.

With deep ITM calls, you pay mostly for intrinsic value, so the options are **very little** susceptible to IV crush and theta decay, and since they are soo deep in the money, their ‚Äúdelta‚Äù is very close to 1. 

If your‚Äôre not familiar with options greeks, the delta is how much an option‚Äôs value moves when stock moves by $1. One share is basically 1 delta, obviously.

Take $30c 7/16, for example, going for $38.22 at close, when GME was $65. Notice that break even is just $68.22 ($30 strike + $38.22 premium) which means that only $3.22 is the extrinsic value, which can decay, all the rest is intrinsic value and this call‚Äôs delta is about 91%. Also, if GME moves just by over 4.9% by July, your call is profitable. 

Here are two scenarios, to compare:
1. You buy 100 shares at $65, you invested $6500 and if GME goes to $130 and doubles, you made $6500 or 100% of profit.
2. You buy $30c 7/16. Market Maker buys 91 shares to hedge (because delta is 0.91). You invested $3800 dollars. If GME goes to $130, your call will have appreciated by $65 x 0.91 = $59.15, to $97.15. While you‚Äôve made a slightly smaller lump sum, you have earned 155% in #2 vs. 100% in #1, and you used only 2/3 of capital. 

So, instead of buying 200 shares and thus creating 200 delta, you could have bought 3 such calls, for 270 delta (or the number of shares a MM would have to buy to hedge).

So, to summarize:
* your net effect on the share price is similar to buying 100 shares, because delta is close to 1 and MMs buy shares to hedge when they sell calls
* Much more capital friendly, you get a lot more delta per dollar invested
* Much higher profits, in percents, for the same absolute stock movement, because your initial investment is much less.

Downsides? Well, your profits move much more quickly, but so do your losses, and this is a call, after all, so you do risk losing it all if GME falls below the strike. However, your losses are capped at the premium you paid, vs. the total share price when you buy shares.

GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze [1] and infinite short squeeze [2]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

Note: A primer on gamma squeeze:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/

Market Maker [1] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1.	‚Å†Few GME shares to hedge.
2.	‚Å†Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3.	‚Å†January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4.	‚Å†Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze &amp; Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

Infinite Gamma Squeeze

Should million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying [1]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral. If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a exponentially worse gamma squeeze, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

tldr;

There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.

Edit1: Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1.	‚Å†They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2.	‚Å†Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

Edit2:

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

$GME gang: We will win because we have nothing left to lose,"I'm likely a good deal older than most of the ""19 year old degenerates"" on this subreddit (I'm 35). 

Last January things were going pretty good. I had a job, I was engaged to be married, and I had finally felt like an ""adult.""

Then COVID hit, taking everything down. I was put on furlough and then cut from work. The government gave me back my $600--yipee--and told me to fuck off. Meanwhile, after a brief blip, Wall Street bounced back, reaching record highs, making back everything they lost, and then some.

It's a funny thing, because I've seen this movie before. It was called the ""Global Financial Crisis."" Back then, they blamed a worldwide economic collapse on people overleveraging into debt. Not the banks and lenders handing out that debt like candy, of course--the people who didn't know any better and trusted what they were told were to blame for accepting all the rotten loans. I was 21 then, just out of college, and had difficulty finding work. And after the shit hit the fan, it was the banks which were bailed out, not the people. There was a whole fucking movement around this--Occupy Wall Street--that had some good ideas but ultimately went nowhere.

So now I'm sitting back, watching the GME story after a horrific 2020. After the GFC, there were laws put into place to heavily restrict blatant short selling. There were guard rails, in other words, to make sure nothing disastrous could occur in the pReCiOuS mArKeTs. Those EXACT laws are what Melvin et all are breaking in their egregious and idiotic short selling of GME. (How the HELL do you short more shares than are available?) And look at all the articles coming out once again: it's \*our\* fault GME is so volatile. We're causing all this price action, somehow outsmarting billionaire hedges for lulz. We're the reckless and insane ones.

Everyone mentions Michael Burry but no one talks about Mark Baum aka Steve Eisman aka Steve Carrell's character. The events in his specific life were largely fictionalized in The Big Short, but the fact is he had big ""fuck corruption"" energy in the film, and that's largely what motivated him to bet against CDOs.

So you're telling me for the low low price of $60 I can buy a few shares, join in unity with others who are struggling and never got help, make the funds performing illegal activity bleed a billion a week, \*and\* make a few bucks doing it? Hell yes, I'm in GME gang.

What all these articles and funds don't understand is we're not doing this because it's ""fun"" or because we're a hive mind or because we think we are trading gurus. We're doing it because we have no other options left. We're doing it because we want a crack at getting out of the chains YOU put us in. Fuck you. You'll keep trying to scare us, but we don't care, because all we have to do is smile and wait, while every day that passes and dollar that rises causes you pain.

Hold the line, everyone. We're going to $1,000. The squeeze has yet to squoze.

Buy in Monday? Discussion,"Hey guys. Retard here with an even more retarded question.

I know no one has a crystal ball, but there was something on my mind I wanted to discuss. I did some reading here and there, but I welcome more input.

1)I see people mentioning sell prices of $420, $460.69 (nice) upwards of $1000 or more.  How likely are these numbers occurring?

2) Do you think I should add another 30k-90k into GME to the hold the line? (No, I can't afford to lose it and as long, but so long as it doesn't come crashing under $50 I'd be okay.

3)Bull case? Base case? Bear case? What unknown catalysts risks do you foresee that you would like to share?

TLDR: OP is thinking about adding 50k+ into GME but doesn't want to lose his pants and get rekt by a bear.

When GME ever closes above $690 for one single day I will buy out one entire GameStop location and make #GameStopChallenge trending.,"Posting this bc it's keep getting auto-deleted from r/wsb (feel free to post this for me if you can)

TL;DR at the bottom.

Recently, MrBeast  bought out 5 GameStop stores and all the merchandise/stock they had available only to give it away as [his YouTube content](https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/mrbeast-spends-insane-amount-buying-out-five-stores-just-to-give-it-all-away-1492607/).

We all know there's a historical scale short squeeze coming soon which will cause a legendary redistribution of wealth.

We all know üåàüêª are fucked with something they've never been penetrated by.

We are all buying shares at any given price like rabid investors &amp; üíéüôå.

I sold my 1/29 calls way too early Friday and bought shares almost at the top at $68 and will be buying WAY more shares come Monday 1/25.

And let this post be another one of my commitment to this historical movement.

When GME ever closes above $690 for one single day, I will be buying out one entire GameStop store and donate most of the merchandise to a charity and make **#GameStopChallenge** trending.

This in effect will achieve 5 great things:

1. Help boost GameStop sales.
2. Potentially save a closing store by: a. helping the sales of that one location &amp; b. by giving it enough public attention and keeping its flow and foot traffic steady for months with a potential media/news coverage.
3. Returning favor to society and community.
4. Potentially start a movement which will be followed by my other autists in this sub and looping effects 1 \~ 3 above.
5. Giving WSB a good reputation, positive media coverage, and helping the community grow and mature into something net neutral or positive.

Disclaimer: No I'm not a influencer or any kind of internet celebrity and no I don't have a YouTube channel that I wish to create, shill, and grow. This is purely for the meme spirit.

P.S. $690 is just an arbitrary number and will not sell below $1000.

**TL;DR: I buy everything in one GameStop when GME close $690.**

Why you should buy powerup Pro from gamestop,"Heres my idea.

In Lemon mans latest rant ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab\_channel=CitronResearch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=CitronResearch)) , he says, the only way to ""save gamestop is actually buying something from them"". So I do my research. Mods I am not breaking any rules saying this, do your own research before investing anything.

My idea is all in the PowerupPro subscription. [https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/#gameinformerZone)

Powerup pro is gamestops subscription service. For 15$ a month you get 5$ upfront and 5$ every month for the year. In total this is 65 USD. This is free money, and way less volatile than actual stocks. What you can do with this is wait 1 year, buy a highly sought-after release (ie COD, some game that has market scarcity) from games stop at the midnight release, buy it for 65$ or whatever price it is (even though you yourself have only paid 15$, and you can then either play this new expensive game at a massive discount or, you can go on ebay and make a 300% profit on your investment, all while helping gamestop (only saying this because gamestop is part of my childhood and minor business does not = fluctuations on the open market).

Also for 5$ extra you can get yourself a copy of [Gameinformer.com](https://gameinformer.com/), which is a fucking steal for something to have on your coffee table.

I'd like your input, and again do your own due diligence. This is an investing forum, and this is a great small game which honestly has alot less risk than other stocks priced similarly. Let me know what you think

**TLDR: The whole Citron attack, the news articles, Cramer etc was planned by pissed off hedge-funds (mainly Melvin) who want WSB to appear to be a single, coordinated market manipulating entity - Source: London Hedge Fund PM**

Hi everyone,

Time to finally spill the beans about what's really going on here. WSB deserves to know.

Long-time lurker here. This is a crazy but true story so buckle-up for a wild-ride. Here is evidence of my conversations with the mods, before the Shitron shit went down. Most of the complex, sensitive stuff was explained via signal call with OIP. Numerous emails which would be too long too disclose and also containing sensitive info were exchanged (takes centuries to write this shit out as you can see) but here are the things which I can release. It's very hard to prove everything because it's based on a tip I got from a reliable source and I don't have a recording of my calls with him or OIP, but here's proof I can provide without compromising certain people that I know what I'm talking about:

[OIP confirming on Thursday that my warnings were true and panned out exactly how I said they would](https://imgur.com/a/5TmznIF)

**Storytime:**

Earlier this week (I'm British) I sent an urgent message to the mods via a private channel (truth is if I put the full details of that screenshot some people involved who may be reading this will figure out the source potentially) warning them about information I received from a hedge fund trader at a boutique British fund who happens to be in the know about a lot of things going on behind the scenes in the market (he has friends in the SEC from his time in NYC) . I contacted the mods as fast as possible, I warned of a ridiculous conspiracy, some shit uncovered that was ridiculously crazy and that the mods had to know urgently. I gave them my encrypted email and phone. I got on a Signal call with OIP for some time, but also talked to Bacon Futures and¬†[u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/)¬†about this situation. Everything I told them panned out, in the specific ways I said (I didn't know it would be Citron tweeting, but I knew and told OIP that some unexpected people with weight and attention would get involved very soon and take on WSB head-on). Initially I was treated like a jokeman and a crazy conspiracy theorist but zjz and Bacon both came around in the end. The 3 mods I have referred to will hopefully confirm in the comment section below that I indeed did warn ahead of these events unfolding.

**But anyways, it's time you guys hear what my source had to say:**

He warned that there were many more hedge funds involved with the naked short-selling of GME and that the recent short/gamma squeeze had really pissed off quite a few people who were now faced with the prospects of huge losses on their books. Ever since WSB was covered by Luke Kawa on Bloomberg, firms have been keeping an eye on the sub. But this was the final straw, when retail investors just fucked over the institutions who are so used to manipulating markets the way they want through illegal practices such as naked short-selling. They were pissed off, royally, and finally decided to do something about the growing retail investor base (WSB) who were making money too easily, and that too at their expense.

Their plan is simple.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **First of all, get the finance world to start covering WSB again heavily. Notice how there wasn't much coverage before of all the crazy things people on this sub have bought and how far they went up?**¬†But recently, everyone's focused on WSB. They have to push the narrative that we are out-of-control retail investors (Brits like me who use CFDs are exempt lol) who are an institution, a solid group, manipulating markets. This turns the public perception of WSB, what is a retarded forum famous for both immense gain and loss porn, into a group of highly coordinated manipulators fueled by nothing but short-term greed.¬†**Barrons, Cramer, Seeking Alpha, Business Insider, Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch, even VICE FUCKING NEWS**¬†etc everyone's on us. Never had this much coverage. It's all paid jobs coordinated across the media to draw attention to this. It's also to draw attention away from the fact that they engaged in naked short-selling and that's a key reason why the squeeze has been so hard.  
 
2. **Collude together to get someone who is considered a heavyweight to intervene and take on the WSB head on, explicitly.**¬†I told OIP on Monday that there were much bigger fish involved in this and that we'd rattled the hornet's nest and that my source didn't want to give me a name but he said they were well-known short-sellers. He said their goal was to act as the public muscle on behalf of Melvin (remember how he sucked Melvin off completely during the video?) and others with an unexpected entrance (to spice things up and again draw public attention) and paint a straw-man of Reddit traders being the sole force behind GME going up (and not a combination of Cohen coming in, general turnaround buying, naked-short selling squeeze as well as options gamma squeeze from WSB). Not only does the market listen to Citron in general, so some puts can finally go in-the-money (notice how the expiry of the contracts is tomorrow?), but it draws huge attention.¬†**Their sole intention is to villify and demonise retail investors, and to squeeze every penny out of us as they can like they normally do**. The whole situation doesn't make sense from a logical point of view... Why would¬†**Citron enter out of nowhere, shill for Melvin, consistently repeat that GME is going to $20, postpone their speech for ""inauguration"", get ""hacked by too many people"" and then a mysterious person buys puts at the same time as the announcement?**  
 

The whole markets are watching now, Institutions vs Retail. Citron takes on all GME buyers. Surprisingly enough, having told OIP explicitly that we should not act like a coordinated group with the GME pushing unless we want something crazy to unfold (OIP passed the message to the senior mods), the very next day WSB makes a twitter account with inflammatory comments like ""**We are a force to be reckoned with"" ""We are taking over"" ""It's time for us to have a voice""**. My source told me weirdly enough ahead of time that there would be some form of public contact/calling out between short-sellers and WSB.¬†**He literally said their tactic was to draw WSB out explicitly, paint us as a collective single entity which coordinates trades and turn the public sentiment against us**. I literally told this to OIP exactly on the call, that the hedge-fund muscle (didn't know it was fucking Shitron then) were going to come out and attack WSB for the first time directly as a bunch of clueless traders and suckers.¬†**Literally, everything unwound almost exactly as my source claimed they would**. This started happening slowly before but I only got the tip now about the full story. They were bleeding before, they got their buddy Cramer (who's admitted to openly manipulating markets) to push for a GME stock offering to give those gay shorts liquidity. ""Shore up the balance sheet"" and some BS. Constantly moving from side to side. The whole thing is completely off. As I consistently said to the mods in my messages (images), the twitter account plays right into their hands and it's basically doing their job for them. You couldn't get more explicit than saying that you're ""**taking over""**¬†a market and a ""**force to be reckoned with""**. We couldn't be more explicit in trying to get the SEC to investigate the subreddit. Even if we did control the stock market, the worst thing you can do is write these things out explicitly on Twitter where the SEC are known (Hi Papa Elon) to be fucking strict.

**My opinion**: Getting retail investors out of the game has been a goal of the financial establishment for some time. They cannot fathom that what was once a big boys only table has now been democratised into any autist with $100 can buy options and make money. Meme stocks made more money than the hedge funds last year. They want us out of the game. It's that simple. But don't worry, they'll probably put restrictions in the name of ""protecting unsophisticated retail investors from volatility"". They'll ban your options without owning the underlying (but keep an exception for authorised financial institutions) just like they lobbied to class CFDs as swaps and keep them out of US retail's hands (freedom my arse). Pattern day trader rules, hello?¬†**In the future something is probably going to seriously wrong, and they'll pin it on ""the uneducated retail investors"".**

To preserve the future of this sub, we must not act like or even entertain the idea that we are an institution. Deepfuckingvalue made a really good call, and kudos to him.¬†**But the whole GME situation has gone too far, and you know it has when Cramer, Shitron, Melvin and a ton of major news outlets are all hammering on about WSB and GME**.¬†**Not acting like an institution extends to not having a Twitter account which ""speaks on behalf of WSB""**. There's bull gang, bear gang, cash gang, theta gang etc etc.

Fellow autists, I hope you can see this. As for the lead mods, please heed my warnings. As fun as it is crushing the institutions, they have much more power then us retail investors. The SEC itself was founded by a fucking insider trader.¬†**Only 1 person went to jail for the financial crisis but they sent a WSBer to jail for filing a false acquisition offer for Fitbit**. The game is rigged, always has been. Stick to meme stocks, go back to inversing each other to see who wins. Or post diamond in the rough DD which WSB is famed for. Thanks.

High profiles do not help anyone, and it leads to things like this happening which threaten the very existence of our sub.¬†**We may win the battle, but we will most definitely lose the war against these corrupt entities who bribe politicians to get bailed out when they fuck up, make laws to ruin their competition, manipulate markets for their own gain and have a chummy, revolving door with the SEC.**

Citron, Cramer, Melvin. Fuck you. You guys are the true scum of the earth. I don't care that you're short GME, I care that you're taking part in collusion, market manipulation via naked shorting, and the intentional villification of small time day traders.

Just like in 2008, you're coming up with bullshit and trying to sell it as AAA. Just like you villified the poor people and immigrants for taking home loans instead of the people like yourselves who committed securities fraud, you're villifying the small retail trader trying to make some money in a period of massive job losses whilst you continue to manipulate markets as you've done for decades and keep minting money.

GME DD - Andrew Left was lying! Fund Managers are sweating this.,"One of Andrew Left's cases for selling $GME was the fact that shorts can still borrow shares easily and aren't paying high interest rates to hold these shares! This is **blasphemy**. On E-Trade right now its literally **impossible** to short the stock (no shares available, check picture). E-Trade is one of the largest trading platforms in the world!

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zrtz5c8e0uc61.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=784fbbb3de426dc7f2cad36c7730e0150d871c4e

And when you were able to short the stock the borrow rates were **astronomical**..... not ""average"" as he suggests.... I have posted proof of that as well (I was short GME for a while. Gay bear I know). He paints a picture as if these huge hedge funds are short GME and willing to wait it out for months for their ""thesis"" to prove true. I also believe this is false.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hgcbhjdh0uc61.png?width=1491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87c38c9160f110330fc35d7aa710911923c7296b

**The scary thing about short positions is when they move against you is the get larger.** What starts out as a $10million dollar bet against Gamestop at $5 share price is now a $100million dollar bet if the stock price hits $50. Also consider that many of these funds were probably doubling down as the stock ran up. See how a position that was maybe 1% of your portfolio can quickly become 20% or even more.

What Andrew doesn't want to admit is some of these big funds are holding **massive** bags. I guarantee you it's getting to the point where the juice is no longer worth the squeeze. Shares are getting called back, margin terms are changing (it happened at E-trade), and firms are paying super high interest rates just to hold their position. Not to mention this is happening in the middle of a crazy bull run. Do fund managers really want to continue holding this position when so much other stuff is hitting all time highs?

Basically what fund managers are beginning to be say to themselves is something along the lines of ""**the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""** Frankly the original thesis doesn't even matter anymore. What matters is the stock is up nearly 1000% in the last 6 months and their short position has become so large that it's a massive liability. They aren't stupid. They a gamma  squeeze could send this thing to $1,000.

What I'm saying is that investors are applying so much pressure that they're going to break. The thesis of the company changed when Ryan Cohen came on board. That's when you saw institutional **smart/big** money get on the long side. The companies who are short want to get out of their positions but they don't want to cover at this price. They desperately want the stock to dip to $20 so they can exit their positions without a MTD portfolio loss of double digits. Remember that the people making these decisions got there because they were almost always **correct**. They are feeling the pressure. One bad trade can unravel everything you've worked for in wallstreet.

**What This Means**: Buy as many shares as you can and hold no matter what. As long as we don't sell we will avoid a massive sell-off. Their aren't enough shares available to short for them to drive down the price artificially.

Alternate Ending For GME,"TL;DR;  Let the bears off the hook if they pay everyone $420.69/share (or some negotiated price).

I was thinking that it might be good to have a different way for this to end. Below are the goals that I had in mind for an amicable ending to this situation and a proposed framework to reach that goal.

# Goals

* Enhance GME‚Äôs financial stability
* Provide capital for execution of strategic growth plan
* Provide an ownership structure supportive of the growth plan
* Ensure no retail investor is a bag holder
   * i.e. Some that made $1000/share and some that missed the squeeze and only made have $100/share post squeeze
* Stabilize volatility in the stock
* Distribute the short squeeze spoils to shareholders more tax efficiently than a short term capital gains windfall
* Offer the bears a (painful but acceptable) exit strategy
   * We cannot kill them or beat them within an inch of their life or they will never agree.  This is kind of like a reverse bankruptcy or setting them up on a payment plan

# Mechanism

Have a shareholder vote at the 2021 Gamestop Annual Meeting (June 2021), to offer the following capital raise and exit for bears.

* Shorts pay Gamestop $420.69 for every Class A share that is shorted to create the missing shares and settle any outstanding short interest
   * Gamestop fulfills any phantom shares to investors who have been sold a phantom share by a short.
   * Gamestop retires any phantom shares that were held by a short to minimize the expansion of Class A shares
* Gamestop creates a Class C with no voting rights (similar to Alphabet or Zillow Group)
   * This will ensure supportive RC has a lot of room to maneuver on strategic execution
   * This will make it easier to do subsequent equity raises for growth
* Gamestop uses the $420.69/share to create a fund for a special dividend for Class A shareholders
   * Special dividend will be paid out $21 quarterly over 5 years
   * The first dividend will actually take the form of 1 share of Class C stock for each share of class A
      * GME keeps this as a \~1.4-1.5 Billion cash from an equity raise which will stabilize the company‚Äôs financials
   * 19 payments of $21 to each Class A shareholder will then proceed
   * If the bears cannot afford this upfront, they can be put on a payment plan
   * Bears can contain their losses at \~30 Billion and move on
* Bears have 60 days to accept these terms or else the price for the offer goes up by $10/share/month

My Position: 1685 shares, 5 16C 4/16

 [GME GameStop Corp. ‚Äî Stock Price and Discussion | Stocktwits](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GME) 

Keep it professional and lets help the bull community become stronger by learning the fundamentals of GME and also the technical analysis of trading the bull trend that GME has experienced on its price charts.

The bearish propaganda machine has been strong since 2019 but it is starting to show cracks. GME is a TURNAROUND play meaning it was at risk of bankrupcty eventually and the stock price reflected that heading into 2020. However, things have changed and now the overcrowded short position is about to get blown out of the water. Even if you dont believe in the epic short squeeze as being possible, GME is on its way to transform into something it couldnt do in the past.

How would GME's board benefit from a short squeeze?,"Obviously rockets are coming and RC is getting super excited for it. While people have been discussing this though, I've been wondering: how does the squeeze directly benefit the board? I assume that it helps them by allowing them to use the shelf offering at the top of the squeeze so that they can get another $100 million while barely watering down the current shareholders (and therefore barely  watering down their own shares \*cough\* RC's 20% \*cough\*). I'm not sure how the shelf offering works but maybe they can even directly go to Melvin and offer to let them cover $100 million worth of shares Gabe has short based on some super high figure (&gt;$100 a share)(i.e. essentially issue the shares to Gabe at an absurdly high price). Based on the involvement of RC in GME, it wouldn't be surprising if he was in on creating the shelf offering and now wants the squeeze to happen so that he and his friends have $100 million more to play with.

Some Fundamental GME Numbers,"Here is a summary of the Statement of Operations for you folks that like the fundamental stuff.

You can see why the stock price has dropped heading into 2019, quarterly results continued to deteriorate. Most recently SG&amp;A have decreased which should help any additional sales go straight to the bottom line(profit). Analysts consensus Estimate for Q4 2020 is $2290 million. Holiday sales disappointed with $1770 million which puts meeting analysts expectations at risk unless console inventory can be replenished and sold before the end of January. If not, then more demand and sales gets pushed into Q1 2021 (Feb and onward).

With SG&amp;A decreasing from the closure of less profitable stores and other cost cutting measures and with the boost in Net Sales expected for Q4 2020, SG&amp;A-to-Gross Profit (bottom left chart) should fall back below 100% as it should.

Consensus analyst expectations is for EPS of +1.42 which would be the highest its ever been in the last 3 years. It will also be the first profitable quarter without Asset or Goodwill Impairments hampering profits.

A GameStop owned digital marketplace that can compete with Steam,"New GME investor. Currently, I see my GME position as a short term position however I'm now trying to evaluate whether I should go long term (2+ years). The low market cap, high short interest, and Cohen potentially paving the way to a new era for the company is extremely attractive.  If a large squeeze doesn't occur in the short term, I see it happening eventually if Cohen executes.  


 One of the questions that has been on my mind is regarding the PC world. I've never shopped at GameStop ever since I switched from Xbox to PC. I can see the angle on peripherals, PC parts, PC building kiosks, but how about games? Imo there's profit to be had for GameStop in this space. Billions are being made off of DLC sales. However I don't see the company penetrating through this market unless they offer some real competition against Steam.   


With the recent shakeup of GameStop's Board of Directors (and potentially Cohen replacing Sherman as CEO in the near future), there's some reason to be optimistic about the company shifting towards e-commerce. Do you see GameStop launching a digital marketplace for PC games in an attempt to compete with Steam? Is this even a good idea? Do you see alternatives?",GME,1610967243,Averos_,7,1,True,2021-01-18

Short Interest continues to climb (squeeze not done),"Recent bearish StockTwit posts and news articles continue to say that the Short Squeeze has already occurred in January. As of January 15, 2021 the amount of shares sold short has increased to new historic highs creating a Short Interest of 114% of the shares outstanding.

A short squeeze occurs when there is heavy short covering that raises the price, which then squeezes more shorts that bought at those higher prices, and continues.

The shorts have doubled down on their shorting instead of covering, so I'll continue to hold my long position until they're all squeezed out.

I've excluded articles that are neutral or critical in a fair manner. There are also other bearish articles from other sources like Barrons that are not part of this list.

Comparisons to Blockbuster,"I have read many comments from doubters saying GameStop is going to be the next Blockbuster.  I'm writing this here to say that that's a highly an INACCURATE comprason, and not really the case with GameStop.

There are four key factors that contributed to BB's rapid decline and eventual bankruptcy:

1) Not getting rid of late fees earlier

2) Not embracing online shopping soon enough

3) Competition with better business models

4) Uncertainty about the company's direction by management

If one were to look at these four factors and try to apply them to GameStop, this is what we get, according to how I see it:

1) GameStop's revenue relies heavily on SELLING, as opposed to RENTING.  Part of the appeal of Netflix when it started out was that it was uniquely positioned in having NO late fees.

That said, I think it would be wise for GameStop to start renting out titles that have been on the market for at least a year.  Players are not likely to pay even half price for games that have been out for a long time, so many of them continue to sit on store shelves collecting dust.  This is especially true for Nintendo games - the price of most of their main titles are rarely discounted even years after their release.  If GameStop launches a plan to reasonably charge people, in store, to rent out games on a monthly basis (with no late fees), they'll get an edge over big-box retailers.

2) GameStop already has its own app, and the company intends on continuously improving it.  Recent reviews I've read suggests many customers are unhappy with its latest update.  GameStop also offers same day delivery for many US residents - something Blockbuster tried in an attempt to compete with Netflix but didn't work out because they were too late to the game

3) It seems like EVERY video game publisher has their own digital storefronts now - not just the major console developers.  Luckily, GameStop's management is aware of this and has adopted the mantra of ""if you can't beat them, join them"".  Earlier in the year, GameStop struck a mutually beneficial deal with Microsoft to take a portion of revenue of EVERY download (not just games) AND online subscription that occurs on their newest Xbox-line.  It also likely that GameStop will strike more deals with other gaming companies.

Blockbuster was given a chance to buy Netflix for $50 million in 2000.  They could have even partnered with them for a year to see how things would turn out.  Instead, they laughed... Guess Netflix got the last laugh.

4) Yes, the Dec 8 earnings call was a disappointment.  Yes, I hate the boomers running this company too.  Yes, I want Ryan Cohen to launch a hostile takeover.  Yes, I see their act of diluting shares as them poisoning any takeover bids.

BUT, you would have to be a fool to think that management actively wants GameStop to fail.  They have closed down many stores not out of spite for the company, but because they've gotten TOO EXPENSIVE to continue operating.  They paid off A LOT of debt recently, and will buy back up 63% of their outstanding senior notes LITERALLY TOMORROW (Dec. 11) in a bid to pay off EVEN MORE DEBT.  

You know how much debt Blockbluster had when they declared bankruptcy?  Almost $1 billion.

My take: Please don't listen to me,"So obviously everyone is disappointed by the offering. I have 1k shares at 16.34 and I'm gutted. BUT - I'm still holding till March for Q4. 

Maybe I'm retarded but the offering might just be necessary to free up the float to actually raise more capital when a squeeze could have fucked the company over (not us because we would have sold). Furthermore, the OmNIchAnNel is actually a good approach and they're going to need to focus on that. Looking at e-commerce sales - fucking glorious. 

Also, there should be a mid January report for all the holiday sales. Idk - I'm gonna diamond hand this shit for as long as I need to",GME,1607467123,thehelper900,5,1,True,2020-12-08

Update: Whassup bro?,"I took a small position in GME because Cyber Monday and the stock was trending. Next quarterly report is due \~Dec 8 which will be through Nov1, then we'll get one \~Mar8 that will include the christmas shopping season.
